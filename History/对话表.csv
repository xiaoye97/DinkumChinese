CLOVER/RandomConvo_002_Intro_001	If possible, I like to start my day with a <favouriteFood>.þ

CLOVER/RandomConvo_003_Intro_000	<IslandName> is an incredible place, y’know?þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_003_Intro_001	The whole island is full of life and energy.þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_003_Intro_002	It’s on a whole other level compared to <SouthCity>.þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_003_Intro_003	That place was full of people, but absolutely lifeless in a weird way...þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_004_Intro_000	<proud>Looking great is the first step towards feeling great. þþ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_004_Intro_001	<shy>I mean, there’s a lot of other steps too, but once you look good on the outside, you will start feeling good on the outside, y’know?þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_005_Intro_000	<thinking>þIf you wear the same colours as somebody, and you can really connect. þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_005_Intro_001	It’s like you start humming in the same universal tune, y'know? þþ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_005_Intro_002	<shy>That’s why I try to wear black a lot.þþI want to try and hum my own tune sometimes.þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_006_Intro_000	<thinking>I was watching you sleep the other night and you were tossing and turning a lot, y’know?þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_006_Intro_001	Are you feeling okay today, <PlayerName>?þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_007_Intro_000	Did you know that the colours red and yellow can actually make you hungry? þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_007_Intro_001	<thinking>On the flip side, blue can calm those munchies down a little.þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_007_Intro_002	How crazy is that?þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_007_Intro_003	<glee>Everything is connected, y’know?þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_008_Intro_000	Do you think the people in <SouthCity> have such stale auras has something to do with <BlobFish>?þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_008_Intro_001	Maybe those critters are secretly evil?þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_008_Intro_002	Y’know, maybe they suck the colour from your aura and make it all dull and grey?þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_009_Intro_000	Do you think <animalName> have soft fur?
CLOVER/RandomConvo_009_Option_000	Try and pat one
CLOVER/RandomConvo_009_Option_001	I bet it is!
CLOVER/RandomConvo_009_Option_002	I bet their fur is spiky.
CLOVER/RandomConvo_009_Response_000_000	<haha>I don’t think so!þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_009_Response_000_001	I like my hair not on fire, thank you very much!þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_009_Response_001_000	<thinking>Y’know, I think you’re right.þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_009_Response_001_001	<yes>That’s why they act all fierce and scary.þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_009_Response_001_002	<haha>But deep down I bet they are big softies.þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_009_Response_002_000	<yes>It probably is, y’know.þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_009_Response_002_001	<thinking>I mean, their teeth are spiky so maybe their personality is the same!þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_010_Intro_000	Hey, <PlayerName>.þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_010_Intro_001	<shy>Have I ever told you I like to practice magic during the night sometimes.þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_010_Intro_002	<shy>Oh, don’t worry, I’m not messing with anything I can’t control.þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_010_Intro_003	<worried>At least…þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_010_Intro_004	<worried>I don’t think I am?þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_011_Intro_000	I’ve been hearing a strange voice outside my window at night.þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_011_Intro_001	It was a little creepy at first, y’know?þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_011_Intro_002	<yes>But the more I hear it, the less strange it’s becoming.þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_012_Intro_000	<thinking>I was thinking, what if you could make clothes so light you could float in them?þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_012_Intro_001	Do you think that’s possible?þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_012_Intro_002	<glee>Imagine soaring above the clouds so high that everybody got a chance to check out your threads.þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_013_Intro_000	<thinking>You always take some time in your day to come and talk to me.þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_013_Intro_001	<yes>I really appreciate that, y’know.þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_013_Intro_002	<glee>So, thanks!þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_014_Intro_000	<IslandName> is full of some great people.þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_014_Intro_001	<no>They don’t all have aura’s as strong as ours, <PlayerName>.þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_014_Intro_002	<yes>But they are good people all the same.þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_015_Intro_000	þWords are very powerful, y’know?þþþþ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_015_Intro_001	<yes>If you say something to yourself enough, you can make it true.þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_015_Intro_002	<thinking>It’s kind of like a magic spell if you think about it.þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_016_Intro_000	<thinking>I remember when I made a red T-Shirt and wore it around <SouthCity>.þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_016_Intro_001	It was just a regular, red T-shirt, y’know?þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_016_Intro_002	<no>But people wouldn’t stop staring at me.þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_016_Intro_003	<haha>It was like I had cast a spell on them!
CLOVER/RandomConvo_017_Intro_000	Do you think I could borrow some of your hair, <PlayerName>?þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_017_Intro_001	I need it for something..þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_017_Intro_002	<shy>Oh don’t worry too much about why!þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_018_Intro_000	I’ve got a contract I need to keep.þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_018_Intro_001	<haha>Oh, no, it's nothing to do with <Dinks>.þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_019_Intro_000	þI’ve never met anyone who’s like you, <PlayerName>.þþ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_019_Intro_001	Everytime I talk to you, I feel like you’ve just given me a bit of your energy, y’know?þþþ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_019_Intro_002	<thinking>It kinda feels like that if you aren’t around, I don’t know what to do.þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_019_Intro_003	<shy>Does that make sense?þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_020_Intro_000	<IslandName> is putting a very powerful feeling into the world today.þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_020_Intro_001	I can just feel it y’know?þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_020_Intro_002	<glee>Something good is going to happen for sure.þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_021_Intro_000	<shocked>Woah!þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_021_Intro_001	<worried>Did you just feel that?þþ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_021_Intro_002	<yes>I totally just felt the whole atmosphere around me change, y’know?
CLOVER/RandomConvo_022_Intro_000	<yes>I’m not a huge fan of fashion, but I am a big fan of making things.þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_022_Intro_001	I like to think my clothes will live on longer than me, y’know?þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_022_Intro_002	<yes>Hopefully, they passed down generation to generation.þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_022_Intro_003	<glee>Imagine the stories they will tell!þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_023_Intro_000	<yes>The <itemName>  on <IslandName> are really something.þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_023_Intro_001	They really help me actualise, y’know?þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_024_Intro_000	I tried to make some clothes out of those <itemName> lying around <IslandName>.þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_024_Intro_001	<glee>In my head, it sounded awesome. All SPARKLY and SHARP!þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_024_Intro_002	But I just couldn’t bring myself to finish the outfit, y’know?þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_024_Intro_003	<thinking>It felt like… all the darkness within them was brighter than the light on the outside?
CLOVER/RandomConvo_025_Intro_000	I love how much you switch it up with your outfits, <PlayerName>.þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_025_Intro_001	Some people just wear the same thing every day, y’know?þþþ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_025_Intro_002	<haha>Sometimes I stare at them, trying to make them change.þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_025_Intro_003	<no>I guess some people just aren't programmed that way.þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_026_Intro_000	<yes>I heard about the mines deep underground. þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_026_Intro_001	<glee>Way down deep, and dark. þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_026_Intro_002	They still <Shift> so they’re constantly changing.þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_026_Intro_003	<thinking>It’d be a really great place to hide something, y’know? 
CLOVER/RandomConvo_026_Intro_004	<shy>If you needed one, I mean.
CLOVER/RandomConvo_027_Intro_000	<worried>I had the weirdest feeling yesterday. I’m so glad to see you’re still with us, <PlayerName>.þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_027_Intro_001	I’m pretty sure you’re going to be fine now, y’know?þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_028_Intro_000	<thinking>Y'know, I never really understood how everything went South.þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_028_Intro_001	<thinking>Maybe we just needed a reason to start all over again?þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_029_Intro_000	<thinking>I’ve thought about putting a little bit more life into my fabrics...þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_029_Intro_001	<no>I just can’t find a way of ethically sourcing the materials for that though, y’know?þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_030_Intro_000	I’m so glad I’ve met you, <PlayerName>.þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_030_Intro_001	<shy>I feel like my life has totally turned around since meeting you, y’know?þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_030_Intro_002	<shy>I hope I’ve made you feel that way too.þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_031_Intro_000	Another great day where I get to talk to <PlayerName>.þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_031_Intro_001	I always enjoy our chats, <PlayerName>.þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_031_Intro_002	I enjoy chatting with all my good friends, y’know?þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_032_Intro_000	Do you think that maybe the universe had always intended for us to meet each other, <PlayerName>?þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_032_Intro_001	<thinking>Like there is some kind of background force pushing us together?þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_032_Intro_002	I just feel like we’re very good friends, y’know?þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_032_Intro_003	<haha>It’s kinda scary how good friends we’ve become, right?þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_033_Intro_000	Last night I had a weird dream that you were being controlled by someone, <PlayerName>.þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_033_Intro_001	<no>They had a window where they could look through it and make you move.þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_033_Intro_002	<worried>It was really creepy, y’know?þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_034_Intro_000	Hey <PlayerName>, thank you for always being there to help me out when I need something done.þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_034_Intro_001	<shy>I don’t think you know how much you have done for me..þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_034_Intro_002	<shy>So I just wanted to say thank you, y’know?þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_035_Intro_000	Sometimes it feels like we’re being watched, y’know?þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_035_Intro_001	<thinking>Like there is someone listening to our conversation right now.þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_035_Intro_002	Do you ever get that feeling?þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_036_Intro_000	<pumped>When you feel that creative spark, you have to grab onto it tightly.þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_036_Intro_001	<no>Whatever you do... don’t let it escape.þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_036_Intro_002	<pumped>Hold onto that energy as long as you can and use it for something really special.þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_036_Intro_003	You never know how long you've got, y'know?þ
CLOVER/RandomConvo_037_Intro_000	Does it ever feel like I repeat myself too much?
CLOVER/RandomConvo_037_Intro_001	Like I’m saying the same thing twice? 
CLOVER/RandomConvo_037_Option_000	Not at all.
CLOVER/RandomConvo_037_Option_001	Sometimes.
CLOVER/RandomConvo_037_Option_002	Maybe?
CLOVER/RandomConvo_037_Response_000_000	Oh, that’s a relief, y’know?
CLOVER/RandomConvo_037_Response_000_001	<no>I’d hate to be predictable.
CLOVER/RandomConvo_037_Response_001_000	I feel that too!
CLOVER/RandomConvo_037_Response_001_001	It’s like I have to follow a script sometimes?
CLOVER/RandomConvo_037_Response_001_002	<yes>At least I got the part though, y’know?
CLOVER/RandomConvo_037_Response_002_000	That’s not a confident answer at all!
CLOVER/RandomConvo_037_Response_002_001	What a weird answer to choose, y’know?
CLOVER/RandomConvo_037_Response_002_002	<haha>Don’t worry though, we’re still friends, <PlayerName>.

CLOVER/SkyFest_Noon_004_Intro_002	<no>There is less noise to distract me, y’know.

CLOVER/TownMention_Level_004_Intro_000	<IslandName> is the best place on earth, y’know?þ
CLOVER/TownMention_Level_004_Intro_001	<no>To think, this place started as a bunch of tents.þ
CLOVER/TownMention_Level_004_Intro_002	I’m so glad you convinced me to move here, <PlayerName>.þ
CLOVER/TownMention_Level_004_Intro_003	<glee>Like I said, <IslandName> is the best place on earth!þ
FLETCH/Already Being Moved 1_Intro_000	<thinking>Hmmm...

FLETCH/Already Being Moved 1_Intro_002	Let's get that finished and then we can think about moving another one, okay?

FLETCH/MoveHouseConvo_Intro_001	Does that sound okay?
FLETCH/MoveHouseConvo_Option_000	Let's do it!
FLETCH/MoveHouseConvo_Option_001	No thanks.
FLETCH/MoveHouseConvo_Response_000_000	Great! I'll take the <sprite=11>25,000 and you take this deed and place it where you want your house.
FLETCH/MoveHouseConvo_Response_000_001	<thinking>You're probably going to want to sleep somewhere else tonight. Maybe outside?
FLETCH/MoveHouseConvo_Response_000_002	<yes>Now these movers are quick, but they can be very rough...
FLETCH/MoveHouseConvo_Response_000_003	<yes>They'll try their best to put your furniture back where they found it, but sometimes they can get it all jumbled up.

FLETCH/Quest_22_Intro_Intro_000	<thinking>Hmmm…
FLETCH/Quest_22_Intro_Intro_001	<glee><PlayerName>, I’ve just been notified that <IslandName> is now eligible to have its own Airport.
FLETCH/Quest_22_Intro_Intro_002	<thinking>You see, <AirShips> can currently only arrive on <IslandName>.
FLETCH/Quest_22_Intro_Intro_003	<yes>But, with an Airport, we’d be able to depart from <IslandName> and visit some of the smaller islands out in the great unknown!
FLETCH/Quest_22_Intro_Intro_004	<glee>Please come speak to me about available deeds when you want to build the Airport.
FLETCH/RandomConvo_000_Intro_000	I’ll tell you what, I really enjoy chatting to you, <PlayerName>.
FLETCH/RandomConvo_000_Intro_001	It’s probably because you don’t talk as much as I do! You really know how to listen.þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_000_Option_000	I wanted...
FLETCH/RandomConvo_000_Option_001	Actually...
FLETCH/RandomConvo_000_Response_000_000	I’ll tell you what! You’re a true blue friend, <PlayerName>.
FLETCH/RandomConvo_000_Response_001_000	I’ll tell you what! You’re a true blue friend, <PlayerName>.

FLETCH/RandomConvo_001_Intro_001	<glee><favouriteFood> is my favourite food! I bloody love them!þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_001_Intro_002	I’m a very lucky lady, I’ll tell you what! þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_002_Intro_000	<IslandName> has changed a lot, I’ll tell you what!þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_002_Intro_001	<thinking>But then again, I have too...þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_002_Intro_002	<pumped><PlayerName>, let’s do our best to make <IslandName> a great place people want to live!þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_003_Intro_000	I moved to <SouthCity> when I was a very little girl.
FLETCH/RandomConvo_003_Intro_001	<no>I’ll tell you what, it was hard to make friends at that age. þþ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_003_Intro_002	<haha>None of the other kids had a clue what I was talking about most of the time!þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_004_Intro_000	<yes>I’ll tell you what, as more people move here, the more it starts to feel like the <IslandName> I remember.
FLETCH/RandomConvo_004_Intro_001	<pumped>I’ll tell you what, if we keep working hard, <IslandName> will be a place everybody wants to live!
FLETCH/RandomConvo_005_Intro_000	Although I lived in <SouthCity> most of my life, it never did feel like home there. þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_005_Intro_001	<haha>I’ll tell you what the place was chock-a-block full of houses though!þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_006_Intro_000	I wish I could help you out more, <PlayerName>.
FLETCH/RandomConvo_006_Intro_001	<no>I’ll tell you what, old <myName> wasn’t always old.
FLETCH/RandomConvo_006_Intro_002	<pumped>I used to run around helping people out, just like you do.
FLETCH/RandomConvo_006_Intro_003	<yes>I was always doing something.
FLETCH/RandomConvo_007_Intro_000	<IslandName> has a lot of different ecosystems for such a small area.þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_007_Intro_001	If I remember correctly, my old home was located on the near North-West coast…þþOr maybe it was South-East?þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_007_Intro_002	<thinking>Hmmm…þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_007_Intro_003	I’ll tell you what, when I remember, I’ll let you know.þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_008_Intro_000	þI’ve held onto that <Journal> I gave you for years back in <SouthCity>.þþþþ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_008_Intro_001	<sigh>It’s the only thing I have to remind me of my Father...þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_008_Intro_002	<no>Oh, it’s okay, don’t worry.þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_008_Intro_003	<glee>It warms my heart to see you beating those milestones!þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_008_Intro_004	<yes>I think it would warm his heart too.þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_009_Intro_000	Ah, I see you’ve already started to make a dent in those milestones.þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_009_Intro_001	<no>Don’t worry, <PlayerName>, I’ve got plenty more <PermitPoints> to hand out.þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_010_Intro_000	I’ve been saving all my life. þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_010_Intro_001	<haha>I’ll tell you what, the only <Licence> I ever needed was the <Licence> to give <Licences>!þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_011_Intro_000	I’ll tell you what, I really enjoy chatting to you, <PlayerName>.
FLETCH/RandomConvo_011_Intro_001	It’s probably because you don’t talk as much as I do! You really know how to listen.þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_011_Option_000	I wanted...

FLETCH/RandomConvo_011_Response_001_000	I’ll tell you what! You’re a true blue friend, <PlayerName>.
FLETCH/RandomConvo_012_Intro_000	<thinking>I know we’re a long way from <SouthCity> and I could probably just hand out all your <Licences> to you straight away...
FLETCH/RandomConvo_012_Intro_001	<no>But let me tell you, <PlayerName>, you’re not going very far in life unless you work hard to get what you want!
FLETCH/RandomConvo_013_Intro_000	I’ll tell you what, I used to dream of becoming a <Nomad>. You know, getting out of <SouthCity>, exploring the world...
FLETCH/RandomConvo_013_Intro_001	<shocked>Oh!þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_013_Intro_002	<haha>I guess that's exactly what we did!þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_013_Intro_003	<glee>It just goes to show you’re never too old for a change!þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_014_Intro_000	<yes>Let me tell you, even though I hate doing it, I’m bloody grouse at paperwork.
FLETCH/RandomConvo_014_Intro_001	<shy>It’s just something I picked up quickly in <SouthCity>. þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_014_Intro_002	<haha>I guess it made me look like I was a local!þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_014_Intro_003	<yes>I’ll tell you what, if you wanted to do something in <SouthCity>, you needed a form to do it. þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_015_Intro_000	Have a think about which <PermitPoints> you want to spend first.
FLETCH/RandomConvo_015_Intro_001	I’ll tell you what, you look like somebody that’ll nab all of them.
FLETCH/RandomConvo_015_Intro_002	There’s some that will make things much easier!
FLETCH/RandomConvo_016_Intro_000	Hey <PlayerName>. You know, <myName> is actually my surname, right?þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_016_Option_000	What’s your first name?
FLETCH/RandomConvo_016_Option_001	Why does everyone call you that?
FLETCH/RandomConvo_016_Response_000_000	<thinking>Hmmm…
FLETCH/RandomConvo_016_Response_000_001	<haha>I’ll tell you what, I might tell you one day...
FLETCH/RandomConvo_016_Response_001_000	<yes>Everyone called my Father <myName>. It was just easier.
FLETCH/RandomConvo_016_Response_001_001	<haha>I guess the name just stuck on me too!
FLETCH/RandomConvo_017_Intro_000	<pumped>There’s so much for us still to discover here on <IslandName>!
FLETCH/RandomConvo_017_Intro_001	<glee>I can’t I just can’t wait to hear all about it.
FLETCH/RandomConvo_018_Intro_000	<no>You really should sleep more often <PlayerName>, it’s no good to run around with low energy!
FLETCH/RandomConvo_018_Intro_001	I'll tell you what, why not take the rest of the day off?
FLETCH/RandomConvo_019_Intro_000	You know what I hated most about <SouthCity>?
FLETCH/RandomConvo_019_Intro_001	<no>The terrible, terrible food they have there.
FLETCH/RandomConvo_019_Intro_002	<BlobFish>? Forget about that!þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_019_Intro_003	<no>I’ll tell you what, those things tasted like wet cardboard.þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_019_Intro_004	<haha>Except wet cardboard has more texture!
FLETCH/RandomConvo_020_Intro_000	Thank you for looking after my Father’s <Journal>.þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_020_Intro_001	<proud>I’ll tell you what, some of those milestones will be tough to beat!þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_020_Intro_002	<yes>But take your time, <PlayerName>.þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_020_Intro_003	<glee>I’m sure you’ll reach them eventually!
FLETCH/RandomConvo_021_Intro_000	I’ll tell you what, it’s just really nice to get out and about every once in a while, eh?þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_021_Intro_001	<proud>Exercise really gets my blood pumping!þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_022_Intro_000	<thinking>The animals on <IslandName> aren’t quite the same as I remember themþ...þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_022_Intro_001	<yes>I guess so much has happened since thenþ.
FLETCH/RandomConvo_022_Intro_002	For all of usþ.
FLETCH/RandomConvo_023_Intro_000	I don’t know why there’s so little motivation in <SouthCity>.
FLETCH/RandomConvo_023_Intro_001	Why people don’t have a sense of adventure or passion.þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_023_Intro_002	<yes>I suppose those that do just don’t last long thereþ...
FLETCH/RandomConvo_024_Intro_000	I’ll tell you what, if I were younger...
FLETCH/RandomConvo_024_Intro_001	<haha>I still don’t think I’d be able to do all the things you do, <PlayerName>! 
FLETCH/RandomConvo_025_Intro_000	I'll tell you what, <PlayerName>.
FLETCH/RandomConvo_025_Intro_001	<pumped>We’ve been getting on like a house on fire!
FLETCH/RandomConvo_025_Intro_002	<shy>Thanks for keeping on keeping on, you little rascal you.
FLETCH/RandomConvo_026_Intro_000	I’ll tel you what, you can stand around all day waiting for something to happen…þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_026_Intro_001	<proud>Or you can get out there and get it done!þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_026_Intro_002	<yes>I like that about you, <PlayerName>.
FLETCH/RandomConvo_026_Intro_003	<haha>I tell you what, you’ve been getting it done.þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_027_Intro_000	I’ll tell you what, age has a funny way of sneaking up on you.þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_027_Intro_001	If you keep yourself busy and focused, you don’t notice it happening at all!þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_027_Intro_002	<haha>þI remember catching my reflection once and thinking “Who’s this old lady in my house?”
FLETCH/RandomConvo_028_Intro_000	For a long long time I felt like I was just treading water and waiting for something big to happen.þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_028_Intro_001	<no>You really can’t be like that though.þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_028_Intro_002	<thinking>Not if you want to be happy.þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_028_Intro_003	<proud>You have to MAKE things happen yourself!
FLETCH/RandomConvo_028_Intro_004	<yes>Give yourself a goal, a purpose!þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_028_Intro_005	<pumped>Beat those milestones!þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_029_Intro_000	It’s funny how things change when you get older...þþ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_029_Intro_001	<shy>I look back at times I felt embarrassed, and they just make me chuckle now.þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_029_Intro_002	Things I cared about so much can just seem silly.þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_029_Intro_003	Time can really put things into perspective, don’t you think?þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_029_Intro_004	The rough stuff gets sanded over, but the bright stuff shines even brighter!
FLETCH/RandomConvo_030_Intro_000	I’ll tell you what, saving up for all these years, I would have never imagined seeing <IslandName> look like this again.þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_030_Intro_001	<yes>While it’s not exactly how I remember it, it feels nice knowing that <IslandName> is someone's home again.þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_030_Intro_002	I think my Father would be very proud of what we’ve done here, <PlayerName>.þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_030_Intro_003	<haha>But I’ll tell you what, I’m very proud of what you’ve done here!þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_031_Intro_000	<yes>It’s always so nice to see you <PlayerName>.þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_031_Intro_001	<shy>I’ll tell you what, if I don’t get to talk to you at least once a day, I feel like I’ve missed out!þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_032_Intro_000	<sigh>I really wish you could have met my Father, <PlayerName>.þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_032_Intro_001	<haha>He would give you a run for your money, let me tell you!þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_032_Intro_002	<glee>It felt like that man could never run out of energy!þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_033_Intro_000	You’re the best thing that ever happened to me, <PlayerName>.þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_033_Intro_001	Sometimes I keep myself up late at night imagining that someone else responded to that ad...þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_033_Intro_002	<worried>Oh, no!þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_033_Intro_003	<no>But I’ll tell you what, there is no point in thinking like that!þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_033_Intro_004	<haha>You’re here, and that’s all that matters!þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_034_Intro_000	My father always used to say: “You keep your friends close, and your best friends closer.”þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_034_Intro_001	<haha> He wasn’t much of a wordy, but he knew how to get things done, make no mistake.þ
FLETCH/RandomConvo_034_Intro_002	<yes>Always looking out for his friends, he was.þ

FLETCH/SkyFest_AfterNoon_006_Intro_000	The <PaperLantern> event has started, <PlayerName>!
FLETCH/SkyFest_AfterNoon_006_Intro_001	<glee>Please go enjoy yourself!
FLETCH/SkyFest_AfterNoon_006_Option_000	How do I play?
FLETCH/SkyFest_AfterNoon_006_Option_001	Any tips for me?
FLETCH/SkyFest_AfterNoon_006_Option_002	Bye for now!
FLETCH/SkyFest_AfterNoon_006_Response_000_000	Well, the aim of the game is to hit down as many <PaperLanterns> from the sky as you can!
FLETCH/SkyFest_AfterNoon_006_Response_000_001	Each one will drop a <itemName> once you’ve hit it!
FLETCH/SkyFest_AfterNoon_006_Response_000_002	<haha>The best way to hit them down is using your <Kite>, but I won't stop you from being creative.
FLETCH/SkyFest_AfterNoon_006_Response_000_003	You should bring any <itemName> back here to this table to claim rewards from the reward box.
FLETCH/SkyFest_AfterNoon_006_Response_000_004	Good luck, <PlayerName>!
FLETCH/SkyFest_AfterNoon_006_Response_001_000	Well, if you stand still, you’ll notice the <Kite> will go wherever you’re looking.
FLETCH/SkyFest_AfterNoon_006_Response_001_001	If you “use” your <Kite>, you’ll let out some string and the <Kite> will go much higher.
FLETCH/SkyFest_AfterNoon_006_Response_001_002	It’s easier to aim your <Kite> while doing this and standing still.
FLETCH/SkyFest_AfterNoon_006_Response_001_003	<thinking>When I was a bit younger, I found this the best strategy:
FLETCH/SkyFest_AfterNoon_006_Response_001_004	Get close to a <PaperLantern>, “use” your <Kite> to let out some string to make the <Kite> go higher.
FLETCH/SkyFest_AfterNoon_006_Response_001_005	Then, try to line things up by watching where your <Kite>’s string is.
FLETCH/SkyFest_AfterNoon_006_Response_001_006	<yes>With a bit of practice, I’m sure you’ll get the hang of it <PlayerName>!
FLETCH/SkyFest_AfterNoon_006_Response_002_000	Good luck, <PlayerName>!
FLETCH/SkyFest_Morning_006_Intro_000	Happy <SkyFest> to you, <PlayerName>!
FLETCH/SkyFest_Morning_006_Intro_001	I've got some great activities planned for today, so I hope you'll stick around!
FLETCH/SkyFest_Morning_006_Option_000	What day is it?

FLETCH/SkyFest_Morning_006_Response_000_000	Today is <SkyFest>!
FLETCH/SkyFest_Morning_006_Response_000_001	You see, today is the day where we’ll see the <Aurora>!
FLETCH/SkyFest_Morning_006_Response_000_002	<yes>It’s a very rare occurrence, even here on <IslandName>.
FLETCH/SkyFest_Morning_006_Response_000_003	<glee>So, today we’re celebrating the sky with some fun activities while we wait.
FLETCH/SkyFest_Morning_006_Response_000_004	<glee>I hope you’ll join in too, <PlayerName>.
FLETCH/SkyFest_Morning_006_Response_001_000	Well, around 11:00 everyone will be making a <Kite>!
FLETCH/SkyFest_Morning_006_Response_001_001	Be sure to come talk to me around 11:00 to get your <itemName>.
FLETCH/SkyFest_Morning_006_Response_001_002	<proud>I’ve got enough for everyone!
FLETCH/SkyFest_Morning_006_Response_001_003	<glee>A bit later on, we’ll start the <PaperLantern> event.
FLETCH/SkyFest_Morning_006_Response_001_004	<yes>I’ll explain how that works a bit later.
FLETCH/SkyFest_Morning_006_Response_001_005	And of course, everyone is looking forward to the main event. 
FLETCH/SkyFest_Morning_006_Response_001_006	The <Aurora>!
FLETCH/SkyFest_Morning_006_Response_001_007	A beautiful and rare natural occurrence, later tonight.
FLETCH/SkyFest_Morning_006_Response_002_000	Righto!þ
FLETCH/SkyFest_Morning_006_Response_002_001	Don’t forget to come back a bit later to get your <itemName>!
FLETCH/SkyFest_Morning_006_Response_002_002	Until then, enjoy yourself, <PlayerName>.þ
FLETCH/SkyFest_Night_006_Intro_000	<glee>The <Aurora> is in full swing!
FLETCH/SkyFest_Night_006_Intro_001	<glee>We should be able to see it all night here on <IslandName>.
FLETCH/SkyFest_Night_006_Intro_002	<shy>I hope you’ve had some fun today, <PlayerName>.
FLETCH/SkyFest_Night_006_Intro_003	The prize box will be here in the Band Stand all night, but the lanterns will stop once it gets late.
FLETCH/SkyFest_Night_006_Intro_004	<yes>So make sure you try and get as many tickets as you can before then!
FLETCH/SkyFest_Night_006_Intro_005	<haha>Hopefully the <Aurora> won’t distract you too much!
FLETCH/SkyFest_Noon_006_Intro_000	Have you made your <Kite> yet, <PlayerName>?
FLETCH/SkyFest_Noon_006_Intro_001	Don’t forget you can make your <Kite> at the <KiteMakingTable> near the steps of the Band Stand.
FLETCH/SkyFest_Noon_006_Option_000	I've made my kite!
FLETCH/SkyFest_Noon_006_Option_001	Talk to you soon
FLETCH/SkyFest_Noon_006_Response_000_000	That’s great, <PlayerName>!þ
FLETCH/SkyFest_Noon_006_Response_000_001	You’re going to need a <Kite> for the <PaperLantern> event.
FLETCH/SkyFest_Noon_006_Response_000_002	Why don’t you go and get a feel for flying it before we start the event?
FLETCH/SkyFest_Noon_006_Response_000_003	<yes>Remember, you can "use" the <Kite> to let string out.
FLETCH/SkyFest_Noon_006_Response_000_004	<pumped>That will let your <Kite> go much higher!
FLETCH/SkyFest_Noon_006_Response_000_005	<yes>The event will start at 3:00, so you’ve got some time.
FLETCH/SkyFest_Noon_006_Response_001_000	I hope you're enjoying <SkyFest>.
FLETCH/SkyFest_Noon_006_Response_001_001	<haha>I'll tell you what, the activities and festivities aren't done yet!
FLETCH/SkyFest_Noon_006_Response_001_002	Don’t forget that we’ve got the <PaperLantern> event at 3:00!
FLETCH/SkyFest_Noon_006_Response_001_003	And of course, you can’t forget the wonderful <Aurora> once it’s dark.
FLETCH/StartingConversationTent_Intro_000	Ah! So, you're interested in applying for a house deed?
FLETCH/StartingConversationTent_Intro_001	I'll just let you know there is a <getHousePrice> up front fee. <thinking>
FLETCH/StartingConversationTent_Intro_002	Oh, and once you've applied for the deed, you will have to source the construction materials yourself. <yes>
FLETCH/StartingConversationTent_Intro_003	So, are you interested in applying for a house of your own?
FLETCH/StartingConversationTent_Option_000	I want to apply for a house.
FLETCH/StartingConversationTent_Option_001	Nevermind.
FLETCH/StartingConversationTent_Response_001_000	Well, I'll let you have a think about it.
FLETCH/StartingConversationTent_Response_001_001	Let me know if you change your mind.
FLETCH/TalkAboutTownStartingConvo_Intro_000	What exactly can I help you with?
FLETCH/TalkAboutTownStartingConvo_Option_000	Can I see the deeds?
FLETCH/TalkAboutTownStartingConvo_Option_001	I want to move a building.

FLETCH/TownMention_Level_001_Intro_000	Although this isn’t the <IslandName> I remember, it's still amazing seeing the changes you’ve made around here <PlayerName>.þ

FLETCH/TownMention_Level_003_Intro_002	Things are really shaping up around here, thanks to you!þ

FLETCH/Upgrade House No Money Tent_Intro_001	...Oh. It seems like you a bit short on cash. <shy>
FLETCH/Upgrade House No Money Tent_Intro_002	Perhaps you can come back when your pockets are a bit heavier?
FLETCH/Upgrade House No Money_Intro_000	Well, to make your house bigger its going to cost <getHousePrice> .  How does that sound?
FLETCH/Upgrade House No Money_Option_000	Yes!
FLETCH/Upgrade House No Money_Option_001	Maybe later.
FLETCH/Upgrade House No Money_Response_000_000	Very good!
FLETCH/Upgrade House No Money_Response_000_001	...Oh. It seems like you a bit short on cash. <shy>

FLETCH/Upgrade HouseTent_Intro_004	I hope you're looking forward to your new house! <glee>
FLETCH/WantToMoveBuilding_Intro_000	So we're going to relocate <relocateBuildingName>?
FLETCH/WantToMoveBuilding_Intro_001	Relocating the building will put the town <sprite=11>25,000 in debt.
FLETCH/WantToMoveBuilding_Intro_002	Is that okay?
FLETCH/WantToMoveBuilding_Option_000	Let's move it!
FLETCH/WantToMoveBuilding_Option_001	Nevermind...

FRANKLYN/Highest_Friendship_Greeting 2_Response_003_000	<yes>Good day to you.þ
FRANKLYN/Introduction_002_Intro_000	Oh. Hello. My name is <myName>.
FRANKLYN/Introduction_002_Intro_001	<yes>I am here to research the old technology buried here on <IslandName>.
FRANKLYN/Introduction_002_Intro_002	<shy>You see, <SouthCity> has some pretty strict rules about what is allowed to be researched there.
FRANKLYN/Introduction_002_Intro_003	<yes>But here on <IslandName> it would appear there are no such restrictions.þ
FRANKLYN/Introduction_002_Intro_004	If you discover any <itemName> please bring it to me.
FRANKLYN/Introduction_002_Intro_005	<proud>You see, I believe that the information on each <itemName> will lead me to making further discoveries.
FRANKLYN/Introduction_002_Intro_006	I will pay you very generously for each <itemName> you deliver to me.
FRANKLYN/Introduction_002_Intro_007	Oh, and I also sell blueprints for some basic recipes.
FRANKLYN/Introduction_002_Intro_008	<PlayerName>, is it?
FRANKLYN/Introduction_002_Intro_009	Yes. I hope you will not be interrupting me too much, <PlayerName>þ
FRANKLYN/IslandDayGreeting_AfterNoon_002_Intro_000	I am shocked to admit that I am enjoying today's celebration.þ
FRANKLYN/IslandDayGreeting_AfterNoon_002_Intro_001	It would appear that <IslandName> is indeed worth celebrating.þ
FRANKLYN/IslandDayGreeting_AfterNoon_002_Intro_002	I have actually helped <NPCName> with tonight's surprise.þ
FRANKLYN/IslandDayGreeting_AfterNoon_002_Intro_003	<shocked>Oh!þ
FRANKLYN/IslandDayGreeting_AfterNoon_002_Intro_004	I will not give you any further information.þ
FRANKLYN/IslandDayGreeting_Morning_002_Intro_000	I do not understand the custom.þ
FRANKLYN/IslandDayGreeting_Morning_002_Intro_001	But I intend to participate in this <IslandDay> nonetheless.þ
FRANKLYN/IslandDayGreeting_Morning_002_Intro_002	<NPCName> informed me she would be auditing my licences if I did not.þ
FRANKLYN/IslandDayGreeting_Night_002_Intro_000	It was actually pretty simple to create these sparkles you see in the sky.þ
FRANKLYN/IslandDayGreeting_Night_002_Intro_001	<thinking>I am considering calling them “Sparkle Works”.þ
FRANKLYN/IslandDayGreeting_Night_002_Intro_002	<yes>This may be one of the most enjoyable projects I have worked on in recent memory.þ
FRANKLYN/IslandDayGreeting_Noon_002_Intro_000	It would appear that these <Snags> look revolting.þ
FRANKLYN/IslandDayGreeting_Noon_002_Intro_001	<yes>However, the flavour is quite impressive.þ
FRANKLYN/IslandDayGreeting_Noon_002_Intro_002	<thinking>Excuse me, but I think they require further research.þ
FRANKLYN/IslandDayGreeting_Noon_002_Intro_003	And by that, I mean eating. þ
FRANKLYN/LearntNewTech_Intro_000	<thinking>Hmmm...
FRANKLYN/LearntNewTech_Intro_001	<shocked>Oh!
FRANKLYN/LearntNewTech_Intro_002	I have a great idea for a new invention!
FRANKLYN/LearntNewTech_Intro_003	Please come and speak to me if you are interested!þ
FRANKLYN/LookingForTechConvo_Intro_000	<thinking>Actually, I have an idea for a new invention…þ
FRANKLYN/LookingForTechConvo_Intro_001	However, I require <requiredCrafterItem>.þ
FRANKLYN/LookingForTechConvo_Intro_002	Do you happen to have <requiredCrafterItem>?þ
FRANKLYN/LookingForTechConvo_Option_000	Here you go.
FRANKLYN/LookingForTechConvo_Option_001	Nevermind.
FRANKLYN/LookingForTechConvo_Response_001_000	<sigh>I see.þ
FRANKLYN/LookingForTechConvo_Response_001_001	<no>It appears you have interrupted me for nothing.þ

FRANKLYN/MakeTechNoLicence_Intro_001	It would be negligent of me to craft a <itemName> for you because you lack the correct licence to operate it.
FRANKLYN/MakeTechNoLicence_Intro_002	Now, if you would be so kind as to return with a <itemLicence>, I would be more than happy to take your <Dinks> and craft a <itemName> for you.

FRANKLYN/NoTechToDonate_Intro_001	Thank you for wasting my time.
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_000_Intro_000	Oh, yes. Talking. Let us do that.þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_000_Option_000	How have you been
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_000_Option_001	What have you been up to?
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_000_Response_000_000	<yes>Everything has been satisfactory.þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_000_Response_000_001	Thank you for asking, <PlayerName>.þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_000_Response_001_000	I have been conducting research.
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_000_Response_001_001	Thank you for asking, <PlayerName>.þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_001_Intro_000	<thinking>I am absolutely astonished with how much interesting technology can be unearthed here on <IslandName>.þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_001_Intro_001	<yes>If you happen to find any, please bring it to me when I am in my lab.þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_002_Intro_000	When I lived in <SouthCity>, I was once allowed to conduct research on the city's power source.þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_002_Intro_001	<shy>Unfortunately, during an experiment I cut power to the whole city for 40 seconds.þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_002_Intro_002	<no>Apparently, making discoveries is not as important as keeping people warm.þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_003_Intro_000	<PlayerName>, I can assure you, there is a lot to be learnt from the past.
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_003_Intro_001	<pumped>Our ancestors may have caused everything to go South, but imagine how advanced they would have had to have been to do that!
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_004_Intro_000	<thinking>If enough information is collected, anything can be accurately predicted.þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_004_Intro_001	<yes>Even the weather!þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_005_Intro_000	<yes>After I start a project my brain is constantly working on it. þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_005_Intro_001	<thinking>Right now, I am actually imagining working on something quite interesting.þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_005_Intro_002	Oh, and I am having this conversation with you too, I guess.þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_006_Intro_000	<no>I am not really in the mood for a discussion. þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_006_Intro_001	<thinking>Let us just imagine we shared in some small talk and became closer friends because of it. Okay?þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_007_Intro_000	<yes>I do wish there were more people here on <IslandName> that could have a real, intellectual discussion with.þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_007_Intro_001	<no>But I suppose I should really be doing research anyway.þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_008_Intro_000	<yes>Sometimes it can take me a long while to complete a project. 
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_008_Intro_001	<haha>I could probably complete a project quicker if I only focused on one thing at a time, but who has time for that?!
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_009_Intro_000	<thinking>Do you think the whole world was like <SouthCity> before everything went south? þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_009_Intro_001	<glee>Can you even imagine how magnificent a world like that would have been?þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_010_Intro_000	<PlayerName>, the way you complete your tasks is nothing short of adequate. þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_010_Intro_001	<no>You never fail to meet my expectations.þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_011_Intro_000	<thinking>You know, <PlayerName>, you can actually be quite bright sometimes.þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_011_Intro_001	I have seen some of the things you have crafted, and I must admit, I’m almost impressed.
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_012_Intro_000	<no>There is no better feeling than finishing a long and difficult project. þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_012_Intro_001	<thinking>Except maybe starting a brand new difficult project!
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_013_Intro_000	<PlayerName>, I think you are actually a very interesting person to talk to. þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_013_Intro_001	<shy>I doubt you really take in everything I tell you, but it does help to get my thoughts out verbally sometimes.þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_014_Intro_000	<no>I just have to stay busy because there's never enough time to get everything done. þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_014_Intro_001	<haha>I have added twice as many numbers to my clock and I am STILL running out of time! þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_014_Intro_002	That was just a silly joke, <PlayerName>.þþ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_014_Intro_003	<no>You can not actually add more time to a day by doing that.
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_015_Intro_000	I used to enjoy reading. þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_015_Intro_001	<yes>I still do from time to time.þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_015_Intro_002	Of course, it is no substitute for active participation.þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_016_Intro_000	<yes>Doing research in <SouthCity> was sometimes very difficult.þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_016_Intro_001	<thinking>I feel like 75% of my time was spent filling out forms to ask for permission to do an experiment.þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_016_Intro_002	<glee>I am very happy to be here on <IslandName>, where people are a lot more… oblivious to what I am actually doing.þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_017_Intro_000	I have discovered that <IslandName> is not only a great place for research and discovery, but also a generally nice place to live.þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_017_Intro_001	Who ever has allowed for a place like this to be built, is truly very clever.þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_018_Intro_000	When I first met you, <PlayerName> I thought you were a bit of a drongo. In other words, a simpleton.þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_018_Intro_001	<no>Although I do not think this anymore.þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_018_Intro_002	<worried>In retrospect, perhaps I should not have shared with you that I had these thoughts at all!þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_019_Intro_000	þSome of the other people here on <IslandName> are actually quite interesting.þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_019_Intro_001	<thinking>I have discovered that given enough study and time, other people can be nearly as interesting as the relics found around this island!þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_020_Intro_000	<glee>Having my own lab to do research in all day has been amazing!
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_020_Intro_001	I had to share a lab with 3 other people back in <SouthCity>.þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_020_Intro_002	<no>There is not a lot of room to do anything even remotely interesting back there.þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_021_Intro_000	<yes>The people that lived before the world went south were very clever. þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_021_Intro_001	<glee>Very clever indeed!þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_021_Intro_002	<shy>Well, besides the whole ruining the world thing they did…þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_021_Intro_003	<thinking>That, perhaps, was not so clever...þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_022_Intro_000	<proud>I managed to acquire all my <Licences> at a very young age. þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_022_Intro_001	<thinking>You see, I was quite clever as a child.þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_022_Intro_002	<proud>To be fair, I also had access to a lot of permit points at the time as a reward for repairing the water supply to my block.þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_023_Intro_000	<IslandName> is a very interesting place.þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_023_Intro_001	<yes>Yes. One might even say, it’s a great place.þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_023_Intro_002	<shy>Oh, and the relics are also interesting too.þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_024_Intro_000	<thinking>I am sorry, <PlayerName>, but I am actually thinking about something quite complex right now.þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_024_Intro_001	<thinking>If you do not mind, perhap we could resume this conversation at a later time?þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_025_Intro_000	The only thing I miss about <SouthCity> is the <BlobFish>.þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_025_Intro_001	<thinking>While I admit they were lacking in flavour and texture, they also contained all the essential vitamins and minerals for working throughout a long night.þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_025_Intro_002	You have to eat them in moderation, of course.
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_026_Intro_000	There are old components hidden underground here on <IslandName>.
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_026_Intro_001	<thinking>It makes me wonder how did they get there?
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_027_Intro_000	<yes>I have been trying to get more sleep. þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_027_Intro_001	<sigh>Unfortunately, every time I lay down I get a new idea and I have to get back up and start working on it right away!þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_028_Intro_000	<proud>With me, you can always count on attention to detail.
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_028_Intro_001	<yes>I am somewhat famous for it.
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_028_Intro_002	What was your name again?
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_029_Intro_000	We are starting to be really “bonza” now. þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_029_Intro_001	Am I saying that correctly?þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_030_Intro_000	Hello there, <PlayerName>. þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_030_Intro_001	I hope you are doing well.þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_030_Intro_002	...
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_030_Intro_003	How was that?þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_030_Intro_004	<worried>Did that sound genuine?þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_030_Intro_005	<shy>I read somewhere that you should ask your friends questions like that occasionally.þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_031_Intro_000	I am quite pleased that you have come to visit me today, <PlayerName>.þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_031_Intro_001	<proud>You are a very satifactory friend.þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_031_Intro_002	<thinking>In fact.þ..
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_031_Intro_003	<yes>I think you might even be a good friend.þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_032_Intro_000	<no>When I first arrived on <IslandName> I would never have thought that you were anything more than a nuisance to my work.þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_032_Intro_001	<shy>As it turns out, you are a good friend and a great person.þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_032_Intro_002	<yes>As well as a nuisance to my work.þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_033_Intro_000	<thinking> Some people say that science is a team sport.þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_033_Intro_001	<proud>If that is the case, I would be the captain of the winning team!þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_034_Intro_000	<thinking>Sometimes I miss the paperwork in <SouthCity>.þþþ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_034_Intro_001	<proud>Luckily I always bring my own.þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_034_Intro_002	Oh, it can be incredibly tedious, but there is simply nothing like tedium to fixate the mind on greater pursuits.þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_035_Intro_000	<yes>I’ve been thinking about the Tele-Towers recently...þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_035_Intro_001	<thinking>Those devices probably work by destroying the user entirely, and constructing them from scratch at another location.
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_035_Intro_002	<no>Fundamentally, it would not be the same person entering and exiting the device, although neither of them would ever notice.
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_035_Intro_003	<haha>Probably best not to overthink it and just enjoy the marvellous convenience of it all!
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_036_Intro_000	<yes>I would get a lot more done if I could grow an extra pair of hands. þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_036_Intro_001	<thinking>þHmm… maybe…þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_036_Intro_002	In the meantime, your help is almost as useful. þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_036_Intro_003	<proud>Almost twenty-five percent as useful.þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_036_Intro_004	Thank you, <PlayerName>.þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_037_Intro_000	I suppose you are wondering why my schematics are always coloured blue?
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_037_Intro_001	<yes>I feel we are close enough now that I can tell you. þþ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_037_Intro_002	<haha>þThe truth is, there is an amusing anecdote about it that is frightfully interesting.
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_037_Intro_003	Thank you for listening, <PlayerName>!
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_038_Intro_000	<worried>My earlier work had an awful tendency to detonate when used incorrectly... þþ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_038_Intro_001	<thinking>...or used correctly, or left alone.þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_038_Intro_002	<shy>I have solved almost all of these problems now, thanks, in small part, to you.þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_038_Intro_003	<yes>It is less exciting, but MUCH more efficient.þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_039_Intro_000	<yes>The oppressive ceaseless clanking and whirring of loud machines was everywhere in <SouthCity>. þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_039_Intro_001	<no>I miss it quite a lot.þþþ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_039_Intro_002	<nop>Yet I notice in you something you could not find in <SouthCity>, no matter where you looked. þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_039_Intro_003	<yes>A spark I find quite admirable. You want to explore and create something new!þ
FRANKLYN/RandomConvo_039_Intro_004	<yes>I think this is why we get along so well.þ
FRANKLYN/SkyFest_AfterNoon_002_Intro_000	Yes <PlayerName>, you are correct.
FRANKLYN/SkyFest_AfterNoon_002_Intro_001	<proud>My <Kite> is beyond incredible.
FRANKLYN/SkyFest_AfterNoon_002_Intro_002	<thinking>You may think your <Kite> is of similar quality.
FRANKLYN/SkyFest_AfterNoon_002_Intro_003	<no>But you are incorrect.
FRANKLYN/SkyFest_Morning_002_Intro_000	Hello.
FRANKLYN/SkyFest_Morning_002_Intro_001	It is <SkyFest> today.
FRANKLYN/SkyFest_Morning_002_Intro_002	I will be conducting various experiments throughout the day using my <Kite>.
FRANKLYN/SkyFest_Morning_002_Intro_003	Please try avoiding me if possible.
FRANKLYN/SkyFest_Night_002_Intro_000	<thinking>Hmmm…
FRANKLYN/SkyFest_Night_002_Intro_001	<yes>I know that this <Aurora> is just an interaction of the planet’s magnetic field and charged particles from the Sun.
FRANKLYN/SkyFest_Night_002_Intro_002	<thinking>But, I must agree with everyone here at <SkyFest>.
FRANKLYN/SkyFest_Night_002_Intro_003	<yes>This occurrence is something worth observing with one’s own eyes.
FRANKLYN/SkyFest_Noon_002_Intro_000	Yes.
FRANKLYN/SkyFest_Noon_002_Intro_001	<proud>My <Kite> is superior to everyone else’s <Kite>.
FRANKLYN/SkyFest_Noon_002_Intro_002	<thinking>I have made sure it is extremely aerodynamic.
FRANKLYN/SkyFest_Noon_002_Intro_003	<yes>I’m sure it will reach the heights needed for my experiments.
FRANKLYN/TechCompleted_Intro_000	Ah, <PlayerName>!
FRANKLYN/TechCompletedNoSpace_Intro_000	<proud>I have completed the <itemName> you commissioned!
FRANKLYN/TechCompletedNoSpace_Intro_001	I think you will find it very impressive!
FRANKLYN/TechCompletedNoSpace_Intro_002	<shocked>Oh!
FRANKLYN/TechCompletedNoSpace_Intro_003	<no>It looks like you don't have any room to take it!
FRANKLYN/TechCompletedNoSpace_Intro_004	<yes>I will hold onto it for you until you have enough space to pick it up.
FRANKLYN/TownMention_Level_001_Intro_000	I have noticed that <IslandName> is really starting to change for the better.þ
FRANKLYN/TownMention_Level_001_Intro_001	<thinking>Perhaps it’s my Lab that has made the difference?þ
FRANKLYN/TownMention_Level_001_Intro_002	<thinking>This might require further study...
FRANKLYN/TownMention_Level_002_Intro_000	It would appear that <IslandName> has changed a lot since you have arrived, <PlayerName>.þ
FRANKLYN/TownMention_Level_002_Intro_001	<yes>Some people might even say that it has changed for the better.þ
FRANKLYN/TownMention_Level_003_Intro_000	<IslandName> is quite nice.þ
FRANKLYN/TownMention_Level_003_Intro_001	Is this perhaps your doing, <PlayerName>?þ
FRANKLYN/TownMention_Level_003_Intro_002	<yes>It would appear that your hard work has paid off.þ
FRANKLYN/TownMention_Level_004_Intro_000	I have been thinking, and it occurred to me that moving to <IslandName> is possibly the best thing to ever happen to me.þ
FRANKLYN/TownMention_Level_004_Intro_001	I wanted to thank you, <PlayerName>.þ
FRANKLYN/TownMention_Level_004_Intro_002	If not for you, then I would have never have moved here.þ
FRANKLYN/TownMention_Level_004_Intro_003	<yes>And if not for you, <IslandName> would be a much worse place to live.þ
GENERIC/12 NPC_Sheila_Intro_000	G’day there, <petName>.þ
GENERIC/12 NPC_Sheila_Intro_001	The name is <myName>.þ
GENERIC/12 NPC_Sheila_Intro_002	<yes><NPCName> got in contact with me and told me to come check out <IslandName>.þ
GENERIC/12 NPC_Sheila_Intro_003	<thinking>When she told me about all the tucker you can find here, I had to pack my bags and come take a look.þ
GENERIC/12 NPC_Sheila_Intro_004	<glee>I bloody love cooking and eating great food.þ
GENERIC/12 NPC_Sheila_Intro_005	<yes>I hope to try all the wonderful food you can cook here on <IslandName>.
GENERIC/12 NPC_Sheila_Intro_006	Lovely to meet you, <petName>.þ
GENERIC/13 NPC_Julia_Intro_000	<wave>Oh, hello.
GENERIC/13 NPC_Julia_Intro_001	My name is <myName>.
GENERIC/13 NPC_Julia_Intro_002	<NPCName> told me about you.
GENERIC/13 NPC_Julia_Intro_003	He's my big brother.
GENERIC/13 NPC_Julia_Intro_004	<NPCName> told me that your name is <PlayerName>.
GENERIC/13 NPC_Julia_Intro_005	<no>I asked him if you liked bugs and stuff, but he said he didn’t know.þ
GENERIC/13 NPC_Julia_Intro_006	So anyway, do you like bugs?
GENERIC/13 NPC_Julia_Intro_007	<glee>I really, really love bugs.
GENERIC/13 NPC_Julia_Intro_008	<NPCName> told me to come visit him here on <IslandName> because there are lots of bugs.
GENERIC/13 NPC_Julia_Intro_009	And guess what?
GENERIC/13 NPC_Julia_Intro_010	<pumped>He was right!
GENERIC/14 NPC_MaxIntroduction 1_Intro_000	G’day.
GENERIC/14 NPC_MaxIntroduction 1_Intro_001	Me name’s <myName>.
GENERIC/14 NPC_MaxIntroduction 1_Intro_002	I’m <NPCName>’s little brother!
GENERIC/14 NPC_MaxIntroduction 1_Intro_003	Speaking of <NPCName>, he mentioned that the <itemName> are migrating around this time of the year.
GENERIC/14 NPC_MaxIntroduction 1_Intro_004	That means today is one of the only days you’ll find them out during the whole day.
GENERIC/14 NPC_MaxIntroduction 1_Intro_005	<haha>As soon as he mentioned that, I booked me ticket!
GENERIC/14 NPC_MaxIntroduction 1_Intro_006	These conditions are PERFECT for a <FishingComp>.
GENERIC/14 NPC_MaxIntroduction 1_Intro_007	So I’m hosting one today!
GENERIC/16 NPC_Nick_Intro_000	G’day <PlayerName>.
GENERIC/16 NPC_Nick_Intro_001	Good to see you again!
GENERIC/16 NPC_Nick_Intro_002	<shy>Who am I?
GENERIC/16 NPC_Nick_Intro_003	<proud>Why, I’m <myName>!
GENERIC/16 NPC_Nick_Intro_004	Don’t you remember me?
GENERIC/16 NPC_Nick_Intro_005	I used to come and visit you and your family every year back in <SouthCity>!
GENERIC/16 NPC_Nick_Intro_006	<haha>Ho Ho Ho!
GENERIC/16 NPC_Nick_Intro_007	What am I doing here on <IslandName>?
GENERIC/16 NPC_Nick_Intro_008	<yes>You see, it’s getting to be my busiest time of the year.
GENERIC/16 NPC_Nick_Intro_009	<glee>So I like to come visit <IslandName> to soak up some rays before things get crazy.þ
GENERIC/16 NPC_Nick_Intro_010	<proud>You could say <IslandName> is my secret holiday destination.
GENERIC/16 NPC_Nick_Intro_011	Well, now that you’ve found me I may as well offer some of my services.
GENERIC/16 NPC_Nick_Intro_012	I can craft you some interesting items, but I didn’t bring my ingredients you see?
GENERIC/16 NPC_Nick_Intro_013	So if you track them down for me, I’d be happy to whip some things up for you.
GENERIC/16 NPC_Nick_Intro_014	I’ve been crafting things for years and years, it really makes me happy!
GENERIC/16 NPC_Nick_Intro_015	Come talk to me if any time you see me here on <IslandName> and take a look at what I can craft.
GENERIC/16 NPC_Nick_Intro_016	<haha>Ho! Ho! Ho!
GENERIC/6 NPC_Fletch_Intro_000	So, <PlayerName> . We made it.
GENERIC/6 NPC_Fletch_Intro_001	Let's find a place we can start building!
GENERIC/Agent_KeeperConvo_Intro_000	Hey, kid!
GENERIC/Agent_KeeperConvo_Intro_001	What’s up?þ
GENERIC/Agent_KeeperConvo_Option_000	Make me something!
GENERIC/Agent_KeeperConvo_Option_001	Nevermind
GENERIC/Agent_KeeperConvo_Response_000_000	Check this out!
GENERIC/Agent_KeeperConvo_Response_001_000	See you around, kid.
GENERIC/AgreeToMakeTech_Intro_000	þExcellent.
GENERIC/AgreeToMakeTech_Intro_001	<proud>I will begin right away.
GENERIC/AgreeToMakeTech_Intro_002	<yes>It will probably take all night, but I assure you, it will be ready by tomorrow.
GENERIC/AgreeToMakeTech_Intro_003	Now, if you do not mind, I have work to do.
GENERIC/AirportSign_Intro_000	The <IslandName> Airport is offering day trips on Sundays.
GENERIC/AtWorkChat_Intro_000	Oh, what did you want to chat about?
GENERIC/AtWorkChat_Option_000	<chat>
GENERIC/AtWorkChat_Option_001	<jobCondition>
GENERIC/AtWorkChat_Option_002	<cancel>
GENERIC/AtWorkChat_Response_002_000	Oh, alright then.
GENERIC/Blueprint_Hand_Intro_000	I can't learn anything new from this...
GENERIC/CompleteHuntingRequest_Intro_000	Thank you for taking care of the <requestedHuntTarget>.
GENERIC/CompleteHuntingRequest_Intro_001	Those Alpha creatures are really dangerous and can cause a lot of havoc.
GENERIC/CompleteHuntingRequest_Intro_002	Here, take <BulletinBoardReward> as promised.
GENERIC/CompleteHuntingRequest_Intro_003	Thanks for keeping <IslandName> safe for everyone, <PlayerName>.
GENERIC/CompleteRequestConvo_Intro_000	Wow. You really found <requestItem>!
GENERIC/CompleteRequestConvo_Intro_001	You're the best <PlayerName>!
GENERIC/CompleteRequestConvo_Intro_002	I really owe you one. Here, take this.
GENERIC/CompleteRequestConvo_Intro_003	Its not much but I hope you like it! Thanks again.
GENERIC/CompostRequestCompleteConvo_Intro_000	Oh, you've got <requestItem> ?
GENERIC/CompostRequestCompleteConvo_Option_000	Here you go!
GENERIC/CompostRequestCompleteConvo_Option_001	Not yet, sorry.
GENERIC/CompostRequestCompleteConvo_Response_000_000	Great!
GENERIC/CompostRequestCompleteConvo_Response_001_000	Oh, okay then...
GENERIC/CookingRequestCompleteConvo_Intro_000	You brought me <requestItem> ?
GENERIC/CookingRequestCompleteConvo_Option_000	Here you go!
GENERIC/CookingRequestCompleteConvo_Option_001	Not yet, sorry.
GENERIC/CookingRequestCompleteConvo_Response_000_000	Thats great. Now I can make <BulletinBoardReward>
GENERIC/CookingRequestCompleteConvo_Response_001_000	Aww . . . you got me excited for <BulletinBoardReward> .
GENERIC/CraftedRequestCompleted_Intro_000	Oh bonza! You crafted a <requestItem> for me?
GENERIC/CraftedRequestCompleted_Option_000	Here you go.
GENERIC/CraftedRequestCompleted_Option_001	Nah.
GENERIC/CraftedRequestCompleted_Response_001_000	Oh, righto, <PlayerName>...
GENERIC/FirstDayFaintConvo_Intro_000	.........<PlayerName>.........
GENERIC/FirstDayFaintConvo_Intro_001	<PlayerName>.........
GENERIC/FirstDayFaintConvo_Intro_002	<PlayerName>?
GENERIC/FirstDayFaintConvo_Intro_003	<PlayerName>! Can you hear me?
GENERIC/FirstDayFaintConvo_Intro_004	<yes>I’m so glad you’re okay!
GENERIC/FirstDayFaintConvo_Intro_005	It looks like you fainted out there!þ
GENERIC/FirstDayFaintConvo_Intro_006	<yes>Please be careful out there and always keep an eye on your health and energy.
GENERIC/FirstDayFaintConvo_Intro_007	<no>If the world starts losing colour you know you’ve worked too hard.
GENERIC/FirstDayFaintConvo_Intro_008	<yes>Please make sure you eat something to keep your energy up.
GENERIC/FirstDayFaintConvo_Intro_009	<shy>When you didn’t return after a while, I had to call for a search party from <SouthCity> to come and find you.
GENERIC/FirstDayFaintConvo_Intro_010	<worried>Those guys delivered you here, but it looks like they went through your pockets and took a fair cut of your <Dinks>.
GENERIC/FirstDayFaintConvo_Intro_011	Maybe they thought you wouldn't notice?
GENERIC/FirstDayFaintConvo_Intro_012	<thinking>It looks like some of your tools have taken a bit of damage too…
GENERIC/FirstDayFaintConvo_Intro_013	Please be careful out there, <PlayerName>.
GENERIC/FirstDayFaintConvo_Intro_014	<haha>I’ll tell you what, I’m glad you’re okay, but I don’t really want to have to go through that again!
GENERIC/FlyOverIntroConvo_Intro_000	We are now flying over <IslandName> and we’ll be landing shortly.þ
GENERIC/FlyOverIntroConvo_Intro_001	All passengers, please prepare to leave the Airship.
GENERIC/FoundPhoto_Intro_000	You got the photo for me?
GENERIC/FoundPhoto_Option_000	Sure did!
GENERIC/FoundPhoto_Option_001	Not yet.
GENERIC/FoundPhoto_Response_000_000	Great! Can't wait to see it!
GENERIC/FoundPhoto_Response_001_000	No problems. I can't wait to see it
GENERIC/GivenCompostIngredients_Intro_000	Thanks, <PlayerName>!
GENERIC/GivenCompostIngredients_Intro_001	Here is <BulletinBoardReward>.
GENERIC/GivenCompostIngredients_Intro_002	I'll get to work making some more!
GENERIC/GivenCookingIngredient_Intro_000	Wow! Thank you. Now I can make some <BulletinBoardReward>
GENERIC/GivenCookingIngredient_Intro_001	Please enjoy this <BulletinBoardReward> .
GENERIC/GivenCookingIngredient_Intro_002	Thank you so much, <PlayerName> .
GENERIC/GivenCorrectCraftedItem_Intro_000	<glee>Thanks a lot, <PlayerName>!
GENERIC/GivenCorrectCraftedItem_Intro_001	<yes>When I put up that post, I knew you would be the one to pull through for me.
GENERIC/GivenCorrectCraftedItem_Intro_002	Here is your <BulletinBoardReward>!
GENERIC/GivenCorrectItemForTrade_Intro_000	You've got yourself a deal, <PlayerName>.
GENERIC/GivenCorrectItemForTrade_Intro_001	Here's my <BulletinBoardReward>.
GENERIC/GivenCorrectItemForTrade_Intro_002	Thanks for trading!
GENERIC/GivenCorrectPhoto_Intro_000	Wow!
GENERIC/GivenCorrectPhoto_Intro_001	<yes>This is a great photo, <PlayerName>.
GENERIC/GivenCorrectPhoto_Intro_002	<glee>Thank you for taking this for me!
GENERIC/GivenCorrectPhoto_Intro_003	Can I keep it? I will pay <BulletinBoardReward>?
GENERIC/GivenCorrectPhoto_Option_000	It's all yours!
GENERIC/GivenCorrectPhoto_Option_001	Actually I want it...
GENERIC/GivenCorrectPhoto_Response_000_000	<glee>Thank you very much <PlayerName>!
GENERIC/GivenCorrectPhoto_Response_000_001	Here is <BulletinBoardReward>!
GENERIC/GivenCorrectPhoto_Response_001_000	<sigh>Well, thanks for letting me take a look anyway...
GENERIC/GivenCorrectShippingItem_Intro_000	<glee>Thanks a lot, <PlayerName>!
GENERIC/GivenCorrectShippingItem_Intro_001	<yes>You've really saved me, I didn't think I would get that shipment filled.
GENERIC/GivenCorrectShippingItem_Intro_002	Here is your <BulletinBoardReward>!
GENERIC/GivenSmeltingIngredient_Intro_000	Thank you, <PlayerName>.
GENERIC/GivenSmeltingIngredient_Intro_001	Take these <BulletinBoardReward>. I just like smelting them and I don't really need them.
GENERIC/MoveInRequest_Intro_000	Hey, <PlayerName>.
GENERIC/MoveInRequest_Intro_001	I've decided I really like it here. 
GENERIC/MoveInRequest_Intro_002	So, I spoke to Fletch, and I've applied for a deed so I can set up a permanent store here in town.
GENERIC/MoveInRequest_Intro_003	I hope I can move in soon!
GENERIC/MuseumMoveInRequest 1_Intro_000	There are so many amazing creatures and plants on this island! <pumped>þ
GENERIC/MuseumMoveInRequest 1_Intro_001	I think it might be worth documenting them all, correct? <yes>þ
GENERIC/MuseumMoveInRequest 1_Intro_002	What if we built a museum here?þ
GENERIC/MuseumMoveInRequest 1_Intro_003	Somewhere where we could gather all of the amazing things here for everyone to see?þ <glee>
GENERIC/MuseumMoveInRequest 1_Intro_004	I’ll talk to <NPCName> about applying for a <itemName>.þ
GENERIC/MuseumMoveInRequest 1_Intro_005	This is so exicting! <glee>
GENERIC/NoItemGiven_Intro_000	Oh, you don't have <requestItem> at all.
GENERIC/NoItemGiven_Intro_001	Let me know if you find <requestItem>.
GENERIC/NoPhotoGiven_Intro_000	Oh, you don't have the photo? Thats ok!
GENERIC/Quest_0_CompleteQuest_Intro_000	So, this is where you decided to build, huh?
GENERIC/Quest_0_CompleteQuest_Intro_001	<glee>It’s absolutely perfect! Our new home here on <IslandName>!
GENERIC/Quest_0_CompleteQuest_Intro_002	Thank you so much for setting up the Base Tent.<yes>
GENERIC/Quest_0_CompleteQuest_Intro_003	Oh, and guess what? I actually have a <itemName> for you too! <haha>
GENERIC/Quest_0_CompleteQuest_Intro_004	<shy>I know it's not much but it will be a place you can call home!
GENERIC/Quest_0_CompleteQuest_Intro_005	Now, there is plenty of room to spread out here on <IslandName>.
GENERIC/Quest_0_CompleteQuest_Intro_006	So please take your time to place your <itemName>.
GENERIC/Quest_0_CompleteQuest_Intro_007	<yes>You’ll probably be visiting the Base Tent a fair bit.
GENERIC/Quest_0_CompleteQuest_Intro_008	<thinking>So keep that in mind while you are looking for a spot to claim as your own.
GENERIC/Quest_0_CompleteQuest_Intro_009	I’ll be inside the Base Tent getting things ready. 
GENERIC/Quest_0_CompleteQuest_Intro_010	Come and speak to me once you’ve placed your <itemName>.
GENERIC/Quest_0_IntroToQuest_Intro_000	Wow!
GENERIC/Quest_0_IntroToQuest_Intro_001	<glee>Smell that fresh air!
GENERIC/Quest_0_IntroToQuest_Intro_002	I'll tell you what, it feels good to finally be back on <IslandName>.
GENERIC/Quest_0_IntroToQuest_Intro_003	Now, <PlayerName>, I’m going to need your help getting settled, okay?þ
GENERIC/Quest_0_IntroToQuest_Intro_004	<yes>I’ll give you this <itemName>. Take your time and find a good place for it. It’ll be like our town hub!
GENERIC/Quest_0_IntroToQuest_Intro_005	Take this map as well. If you have any questions, please just ask me.þ
GENERIC/Quest_0_IntroToQuest_Intro_006	<shy>I haven’t been back to <IslandName> for a very long time, but I think I can still be helpful.þ
GENERIC/Quest_0_IntroToQuest_Intro_007	<yes>I’ll be waiting by this dock until you set up the <itemName>.
GENERIC/Quest_0_IntroToQuest_Intro_008	<yes>So if you get lost, just check your map to find the dock again.
GENERIC/Quest_0_IntroToQuest_Intro_009	Good luck, <PlayerName>!
GENERIC/Quest_0_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Intro_000	Ah, <PlayerName>. Hows it going, mate? Do you have any questions?
GENERIC/Quest_0_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_000	Tell me about the Island.
GENERIC/Quest_0_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_001	Where do you think we should set up camp?
GENERIC/Quest_0_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_002	How do I place the tent?
GENERIC/Quest_0_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_003	See ya!
GENERIC/Quest_0_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_000	<thinking>You see, I was actually born here on <IslandName>.
GENERIC/Quest_0_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_001	<no>Back before we moved to  <SouthCity>...
GENERIC/Quest_0_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_002	<thinking>Hmmm...
GENERIC/Quest_0_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_003	Oh, right. Let me tell you what I remember about <IslandName>...
GENERIC/Quest_0_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_004	If I remember correctly, up north you'll find a tropical climate.
GENERIC/Quest_0_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_005	<thinking>To the south it can get a bit chilly, but I recall my Dad warned me about the wildlife down there…
GENERIC/Quest_0_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_006	To the east and west of the island are flat open plains. The ground is nice and flat, so it would be easy to build there.
GENERIC/Quest_0_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_007	The coasts are a great place for fishing year-round. So if you like throwing a line, it might be worth setting up the <itemName> near the beach.
GENERIC/Quest_0_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_008	<haha>The centre of the island is a desert. It’s hot and dry there, and it’s full of bugs!
GENERIC/Quest_0_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_009	<yes>But no matter where you decide we should build, being close to water is always a good idea. 
GENERIC/Quest_0_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_010	So if you want to set up inland anywhere, try and do it close to a river.
GENERIC/Quest_0_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_011	<haha>I feel like that’s a lot to take in. Sorry about that, <PlayerName>!
GENERIC/Quest_0_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_001_000	It’s been a long time since I was here last! I was a little girl back then, so I’ll let you figure out how long ago that was! <shy>
GENERIC/Quest_0_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_001_001	But I do have two places in mind that might be a good place to set up the <itemName>... <thinking>
GENERIC/Quest_0_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_001_002	The eastern and western coasts both have plainlands that I think would make for an easy building area. <yes>
GENERIC/Quest_0_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_001_003	The terrain there is flat and won't take too much effort to build on. Plus the climate should be good for farming most of the year. <yes>
GENERIC/Quest_0_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_001_004	But you don’t have to listen to old <myName>!  You’re the one running around out there!þ
GENERIC/Quest_0_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_001_005	I’m sure that wherever you decide to place the <itemName>, it will be the right place.<yes>
GENERIC/Quest_0_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_001_006	Now if you have any other questions, just ask!
GENERIC/Quest_0_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_002_000	Ah, good question <PlayerName>!
GENERIC/Quest_0_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_002_001	First select the <itemName> in your toolbelt so it’s in your hand.
GENERIC/Quest_0_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_002_002	Once you use the <itemName> you’re going to have to decide where to place it.<yes>
GENERIC/Quest_0_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_002_003	You’re going to need enough space for the <itemName> to be set up. The only other thing to keep in mind is that the ground needs to be flat and even. <yes>
GENERIC/Quest_0_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_002_004	If you have any other questions, please come and ask me <yes>
GENERIC/Quest_0_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_003_000	Good luck, <PlayerName>!
GENERIC/Quest_1_CompleteQuest_Intro_000	You found a good place for your tent?
GENERIC/Quest_1_CompleteQuest_Intro_001	<shy>I know it's not much, but I hope you like your new home!
GENERIC/Quest_1_CompleteQuest_Intro_002	I'll tell you what, you've got the "spark", <PlayerName>.
GENERIC/Quest_1_CompleteQuest_Intro_003	<yes>You see, most people back in <SouthCity> are scared of leaving.
GENERIC/Quest_1_CompleteQuest_Intro_004	<thinking>There is something about that place that pulls the "spark" out of people...
GENERIC/Quest_1_CompleteQuest_Intro_005	<no>But I'll tell you what, we certainly aren't the first to leave!
GENERIC/Quest_1_CompleteQuest_Intro_006	Have you ever heard of the traveling trader, <NPCName>?
GENERIC/Quest_1_CompleteQuest_Option_000	No I haven't.
GENERIC/Quest_1_CompleteQuest_Option_001	Of course I have!
GENERIC/Quest_1_CompleteQuest_Response_000_000	<yes>I'll tell you what, he’s a bloody legend!
GENERIC/Quest_1_CompleteQuest_Response_000_001	Rumour is he traded a paperclip for a steam boat once!
GENERIC/Quest_1_CompleteQuest_Response_000_002	<proud>Trading is in his very blood!
GENERIC/Quest_1_CompleteQuest_Response_000_003	<NPCName> got in contact with me before we left <SouthCity>.
GENERIC/Quest_1_CompleteQuest_Response_000_004	<pumped>He's interested in visiting with his shop here!
GENERIC/Quest_1_CompleteQuest_Response_000_005	<no>I'll tell you what, we can't miss an opportunity like this!
GENERIC/Quest_1_CompleteQuest_Response_000_006	<yes>I reckon we get this <itemName> ready for him.
GENERIC/Quest_1_CompleteQuest_Response_000_007	<yes>That way we'll have a place ready for any visitors who come to <IslandName>.
GENERIC/Quest_1_CompleteQuest_Response_000_008	I’ll let you decide where the best place for this <itemName> is.
GENERIC/Quest_1_CompleteQuest_Response_000_009	<haha>Just be sure it's closeby!
GENERIC/Quest_1_CompleteQuest_Response_000_010	<glee>We want visitors to feel like part of the <IslandName> community while they are here!
GENERIC/Quest_1_CompleteQuest_Response_000_011	Who knows, maybe we can convince him to set up a permanent shop here!
GENERIC/Quest_1_CompleteQuest_Response_000_012	<yes>Be sure to talk to me once you have placed the <itemName>.
GENERIC/Quest_1_CompleteQuest_Response_001_000	<haha>Who hasn't!
GENERIC/Quest_1_CompleteQuest_Response_001_001	<pumped>He's a bloody legend!
GENERIC/Quest_1_CompleteQuest_Response_001_002	<proud>Trading is in his very blood!
GENERIC/Quest_1_CompleteQuest_Response_001_003	<NPCName> got in contact with me before we left <SouthCity>.
GENERIC/Quest_1_CompleteQuest_Response_001_004	<pumped>He's interested in visiting with his shop here!
GENERIC/Quest_1_CompleteQuest_Response_001_005	<no>I'll tell you what, we can't miss an opportunity like this!
GENERIC/Quest_1_CompleteQuest_Response_001_006	<yes>I reckon we get this <itemName> ready for him.
GENERIC/Quest_1_CompleteQuest_Response_001_007	<yes>That way we'll have a place ready for any visitors who come to <IslandName>.
GENERIC/Quest_1_CompleteQuest_Response_001_008	I’ll let you decide where the best place for this <itemName> is.
GENERIC/Quest_1_CompleteQuest_Response_001_009	<haha>Just be sure it's closeby!
GENERIC/Quest_1_CompleteQuest_Response_001_010	<glee>We want visitors to feel like part of the <IslandName> community while they are here!
GENERIC/Quest_1_CompleteQuest_Response_001_011	Who knows, maybe we can convince him to set up a permanent shop here!
GENERIC/Quest_1_CompleteQuest_Response_001_012	<yes>Be sure to talk to me once you have placed the <itemName>.
GENERIC/Quest_1_IntroToQuest_Intro_000	As you know, we’ve been tasked with starting a new settlement on this island.þ
GENERIC/Quest_1_IntroToQuest_Intro_001	I know you’ve just arrived but I’m going to need your help right away!þ
GENERIC/Quest_1_IntroToQuest_Intro_002	The first thing we need to do is set up a base camp.þ
GENERIC/Quest_1_IntroToQuest_Intro_003	Take this <itemName>. This will be our base of operations as it were. We will be building the settlement out from there.
GENERIC/Quest_1_IntroToQuest_Intro_004	Please take your time to look around the island before deciding where to start our new settlement.
GENERIC/Quest_1_IntroToQuest_Intro_005	Once you have found a suitable place,  you will need to clear out the land to place the <itemName>.
GENERIC/Quest_1_IntroToQuest_Intro_006	I’ll give you some tools that I’ve brought with me. These should be enough to clear some space to set up the <itemName>
GENERIC/Quest_1_IntroToQuest_Intro_007	I will wait here at the dock, but I will meet you at the <itemName> once you’ve got it set up. If you have any further questions please come and see me.
GENERIC/Quest_1_IntroToQuest_Intro_008	I’m so glad you’ve made it here safe and I’m very excited to be working with you!
GENERIC/Quest_1_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Intro_000	Ah, <PlayerName> what do you think of the <itemName>?
GENERIC/Quest_1_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Intro_001	I got it all set up fairly quickly, right! <haha>
GENERIC/Quest_1_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Intro_002	How’d you go setting up yours?
GENERIC/Quest_1_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_000	How do I place the tent?
GENERIC/Quest_1_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_001	I haven't set up yet.
GENERIC/Quest_1_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_000	It's actually the same way you set up the Base Tent!
GENERIC/Quest_1_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_001	First select the <itemName> in your toolbelt so it’s in your hand.þ
GENERIC/Quest_1_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_002	Once you use the <itemName> you’re going to have to decide where to place it.<yes>þ
GENERIC/Quest_1_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_003	You’re going to need enough space for the <itemName> to be set up. The only other thing to keep in mind is that the ground needs to be flat and even. <yes>
GENERIC/Quest_1_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_004	Come back and speak to me once you've got your <itemName> all set up.
GENERIC/Quest_1_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_001_000	Come back and speak to me once you've got your <itemName> all set up.
GENERIC/Quest_13_Intro_Intro_000	Oh, <PlayerName>!
GENERIC/Quest_13_Intro_Intro_001	The towns ecconomy is growing very nicely.
GENERIC/Quest_13_Intro_Intro_002	I think it might be a good time for us to think about maybe building a bank.
GENERIC/Quest_13_Intro_Intro_003	Please speak to me if you are interested in applying for a bank deed! <yes>
GENERIC/Quest_14_Completed_Intro_000	Oh, and thanks for placing the <itemName>. You're a good friend, <PlayerName>. <glee>
GENERIC/Quest_14_Intro_Intro_000	Hey <PlayerName>.
GENERIC/Quest_14_Intro_Intro_001	I've had an idea for something <IslandName> could really use!
GENERIC/Quest_14_Intro_Intro_002	Take this <itemName>.
GENERIC/Quest_14_Intro_Intro_003	<proud>I thought people could maybe put things they don't want in here.
GENERIC/Quest_14_Intro_Intro_004	<yes>I will clear it out on Thursdays.
GENERIC/Quest_14_Intro_Intro_005	<shocked>What am I doing with the stuff?
GENERIC/Quest_14_Intro_Intro_006	<shy>I'm going to recycle it...
GENERIC/Quest_14_Intro_Intro_007	<glee>Anyway, if you could place it down somewhere, that would be great.
GENERIC/Quest_14_Intro_Intro_008	<yes>Be sure to check it every so often.
GENERIC/Quest_14_Intro_Intro_009	<yes>Anything you find in it is up for grabs, so feel free to take it!
GENERIC/Quest_15_BuildTeleporterRequest_Intro_000	<yes><PlayerName>, I see you have been repairing the Tele-Towers around the island.
GENERIC/Quest_15_BuildTeleporterRequest_Intro_001	<thinking>To be honest, I did not think you had the know-how to even understand what they were intended for…
GENERIC/Quest_15_BuildTeleporterRequest_Intro_002	<yes>Regardless, I have come up with an idea to build a <itemName> that we could place wherever we want.
GENERIC/Quest_15_BuildTeleporterRequest_Intro_003	<thinking>Now adding too many would most likely disrupt the Tele-Network.
GENERIC/Quest_15_BuildTeleporterRequest_Intro_004	<yes>So I think we will only be able to build one.
GENERIC/Quest_15_BuildTeleporterRequest_Intro_005	I have spoken to <NPCName> and she has agreed to add it to the available deeds.
GENERIC/Quest_17_Completed_Intro_000	Oh, <PlayerName>!
GENERIC/Quest_17_Completed_Intro_001	<IslandName> is growing very nicely.
GENERIC/Quest_17_Completed_Intro_002	With our current population, <SouthCity> has offically recognised <IslandName> as a settlement.
GENERIC/Quest_17_Completed_Intro_003	That means we can upgrade the base tent into a real Town Hall.
GENERIC/Quest_17_Completed_Intro_004	<proud>I'll tell you what, I'll cover the costs myself.
GENERIC/Quest_17_Completed_Intro_005	If I could ask you to gather items required for the Town Hall.
GENERIC/Quest_17_Completed_Intro_006	<yes>I've put a Deposit Box out the front of the Base Tent.
GENERIC/Quest_17_Completed_Intro_007	<shy>I'll tell you what, you've really changed my life for the better, <PlayerName>.
GENERIC/Quest_17_Completed_Intro_008	<yes>Infact, everyone here on <IslandName> owes it all to you!
GENERIC/Quest_17_Completed_Intro_009	<yes>It's not much, but we wanted to get you a gift.
GENERIC/Quest_17_Completed_Intro_010	<yes>Think of it as a symbol of gratitude from everyone here on <IslandName>.
GENERIC/Quest_17_Intro_Intro_000	<PlayerName>, I've been contacted by some of the people back in <SouthCity>.
GENERIC/Quest_17_Intro_Intro_001	<no>I've been notified that we will need 5 permanent residents before <IslandName> is recognised as an official settlement.
GENERIC/Quest_17_Intro_Intro_002	Now, there is no hurry, but maybe that should be our next goal?
GENERIC/Quest_17_Intro_Intro_003	<haha>I'll tell you what, any visitors that see how nice <IslandName> is will want to stay anyway!
GENERIC/Quest_17_Intro_Intro_004	Once <SouthCity> recognises <IslandName> as an official settlement, we can build a Town Hall!
GENERIC/Quest_17_Intro_Intro_005	<glee>I'm sure we'll reach our goal soon!
GENERIC/Quest_18_Intro_Intro_000	Oh, <PlayerName>.
GENERIC/Quest_18_Intro_Intro_001	<glee>I, like, have a gift for you.
GENERIC/Quest_18_Intro_Intro_002	It's my <itemName>.
GENERIC/Quest_18_Intro_Intro_003	<shy>I've been adding information to it, like, my whole life.
GENERIC/Quest_18_Intro_Intro_004	<thinking>You could probably use it to get some infomation on any plants you are growing.
GENERIC/Quest_18_Intro_Intro_005	<yes>Oh, don't worry about me, I think you'll, like, get more use out of it to be honest.
GENERIC/Quest_18_Intro_Intro_006	<haha>Anyway, I've got all the info up here!
GENERIC/Quest_19_Intro_Intro_000	<shock>Oh, <PlayerName>!
GENERIC/Quest_19_Intro_Intro_001	I wanted to let you know that <IslandName> has been cleared to build 3 additional buildings.þ
GENERIC/Quest_19_Intro_Intro_002	<pumped>These buildings are additional houses!þ
GENERIC/Quest_19_Intro_Intro_003	<thinking>I’ve been told we can use them for whatever purpose we want.þ
GENERIC/Quest_19_Intro_Intro_004	<glee>I’ll let you decide whether the new house is storage, a display home or a place for a friend to stay when they come to visit.þ
GENERIC/Quest_19_Intro_Intro_005	<yes>We’re allowed to have three total here on <IslandName>.
GENERIC/Quest_19_Intro_Intro_006	So come and ask me about the deeds when you want to build one!
GENERIC/Quest_2_CompleteQuest_Intro_000	So, we're all set for visitors, huh? 
GENERIC/Quest_2_CompleteQuest_Intro_001	Well done <PlayerName>! 
GENERIC/Quest_2_CompleteQuest_Intro_002	<pumped>We’ve only been here for a little while, but you’ve achieved so much already!
GENERIC/Quest_2_CompleteQuest_Intro_003	<yes>You remind me of my father. He was born right here on <IslandName>, you know?
GENERIC/Quest_2_CompleteQuest_Intro_004	<proud>He was a true blue Adventurer through and through.
GENERIC/Quest_2_CompleteQuest_Intro_005	He loved doing new things and keeping track of all his milestones in his <itemName>.
GENERIC/Quest_2_CompleteQuest_Intro_006	<sigh>I wanted to come here and try and meet those milestones myself.
GENERIC/Quest_2_CompleteQuest_Intro_007	<no>But I’m getting a bit long in the tooth, <PlayerName>.
GENERIC/Quest_2_CompleteQuest_Intro_008	<shy>Please, I want you to take his <itemName>.
GENERIC/Quest_2_CompleteQuest_Intro_009	<yes>Please keep good care of it.
GENERIC/Quest_2_CompleteQuest_Intro_010	This is your adventure now.
GENERIC/Quest_2_IntroToQuest_Intro_000	<PlayerName>! I received a letter earlier today from someone named <NPCName>. Unusual name, if you ask me.
GENERIC/Quest_2_IntroToQuest_Intro_001	Now I’ve heard of this fella. He’s a travelling trader. More than that, he’s a bloody legend.
GENERIC/Quest_2_IntroToQuest_Intro_002	Rumour is he traded a paperclip for a boat once!
GENERIC/Quest_2_IntroToQuest_Intro_003	Trading is in his very blood!
GENERIC/Quest_2_IntroToQuest_Intro_004	Well, he’s heard about all the hard work we’re doing putting this town together, and he reckons he wants to bring his little travelling store right here.
GENERIC/Quest_2_IntroToQuest_Intro_005	Opportunity is knocking, so let’s answer that door with a smile. Let's clear out some more space somewhere for this <itemName>
GENERIC/Quest_2_IntroToQuest_Intro_006	That way, there will be a place for anyone visiting our island to stay.
GENERIC/Quest_2_IntroToQuest_Intro_007	<PlayerName>, take this <itemName> and place it somewhere you think would be a good place visitors can stay.þ
GENERIC/Quest_2_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Intro_000	<PlayerName>! Have you found a place for the <itemName>?
GENERIC/Quest_2_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_000	How do I place the deed?
GENERIC/Quest_2_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_001	I'm still looking.
GENERIC/Quest_2_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_000	Just select the <itemName> from your toolbelt. Just like you did with the tents.
GENERIC/Quest_2_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_001	Oh and make sure that the ground is nice and flat or you won't be able to place it.
GENERIC/Quest_2_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_001_000	All good, mate. Be sure to come back here once you’ve placed the <itemName>.
GENERIC/Quest_20_Intro_Intro_000	<yes><IslandName> is really starting to grow…
GENERIC/Quest_20_Intro_Intro_001	<thinking>I’ll tell you what, it might be a good idea to build a Band Stand.
GENERIC/Quest_20_Intro_Intro_002	<haha>No, we’re not having any musical guests any time soon.
GENERIC/Quest_20_Intro_Intro_003	<PlayerName>, if <IslandName> had a Band Stand, we could use it as a place to host events.
GENERIC/Quest_20_Intro_Intro_004	We could host parties, gatherings, celebrations…
GENERIC/Quest_20_Intro_Intro_005	<glee>It would be a place where everyone on <IslandName> could gather and just hang out.
GENERIC/Quest_20_Intro_Intro_006	I’ve already applied for the <itemName>.
GENERIC/Quest_20_Intro_Intro_007	<yes>So, come and speak to me if you think we are ready to build it.
GENERIC/Quest_21_Completed_Intro_000	Well done <PlayerName>.
GENERIC/Quest_21_Completed_Intro_001	You have acquired 10 <itemName>.
GENERIC/Quest_21_Completed_Intro_002	<no>I did not think this was possible.
GENERIC/Quest_21_Completed_Intro_003	<yes>I am impressed.þ
GENERIC/Quest_21_Completed_Intro_004	Now, if you would allow me to study the 10 <itemName>.þ
GENERIC/Quest_21_Completed_Intro_005	<thinking>….þ
GENERIC/Quest_21_Completed_Intro_006	<thinking>Hmmm…
GENERIC/Quest_21_Completed_Intro_007	<shocked>Yes!þ
GENERIC/Quest_21_Completed_Intro_008	<glee>I believe there is a way to process this into a usable material.þ
GENERIC/Quest_21_Completed_Intro_009	Studying this <itemName> has given me an idea for a new invention.
GENERIC/Quest_21_Completed_Intro_010	Please, <PlayerName>, come talk to me if you want me to craft you something new!
GENERIC/Quest_21_Intro_Intro_000	Ah, <PlayerName>.þ
GENERIC/Quest_21_Intro_Intro_001	Am I correct in assuming that you have discovered the incredibly rare <itemName>.
GENERIC/Quest_21_Intro_Intro_002	<thinking>I have seen this ore referenced often in the data I have been extracting from the shiny discs.
GENERIC/Quest_21_Intro_Intro_003	<thinking>However, I must admit, I had assumed that it was a myth...
GENERIC/Quest_21_Intro_Intro_004	If you could bring me 10 <itemName>, I believe I may have a way to process it into a very useful material.
GENERIC/Quest_21_Intro_Intro_005	Please come back and speak to me once you have collected the <itemName>.
GENERIC/Quest_3_CompleteQuest_Intro_000	Oh, you've found something to eat!
GENERIC/Quest_3_CompleteQuest_Intro_001	<yes>Eating food will help keep your energy up!
GENERIC/Quest_3_CompleteQuest_Intro_002	Here is the recipe for a <itemName>.
GENERIC/Quest_3_CompleteQuest_Intro_003	I found these stones earlier so you can use these to craft your <itemName>.
GENERIC/Quest_3_CompleteQuest_Intro_004	<shy>You'll have to find some wood yourself though.
GENERIC/Quest_3_CompleteQuest_Intro_005	Feel free to use the crafting table in the Base Tent to craft a <itemName>.
GENERIC/Quest_3_CompleteQuest_Intro_006	Take your time, <PlayerName>.
GENERIC/Quest_3_CompleteQuest_Intro_007	When you are done, come and have a chat with me.
GENERIC/Quest_3_CompleteQuest_Intro_008	<glee>I have a gift for you!
GENERIC/Quest_3_IntroToQuest_Intro_000	<shy>That journal means a lot to me.
GENERIC/Quest_3_IntroToQuest_Intro_001	<shy>But I think my Dad would be glad someone like you is looking after it.
GENERIC/Quest_3_IntroToQuest_Intro_002	<pumped>But, I have a challenge for you, <PlayerName>.
GENERIC/Quest_3_IntroToQuest_Intro_003	<pumped>I want you to try and beat my Father’s milestones.
GENERIC/Quest_3_IntroToQuest_Intro_004	<no>Some of these milestones are going to take a long time to complete, but there is no hurry.
GENERIC/Quest_3_IntroToQuest_Intro_005	<thinking>I’m also going to add daily tasks to the journal. These will be smaller milestones that should be easy to complete in just one day.
GENERIC/Quest_3_IntroToQuest_Intro_006	<proud>Now for the good part.
GENERIC/Quest_3_IntroToQuest_Intro_007	<glee>For every milestone you surpass, you’ll be rewarded with <PermitPoints>.
GENERIC/Quest_3_IntroToQuest_Intro_008	<yes>I'll tell you what, you're going to want a lot of <PermitPoints> eventually.
GENERIC/Quest_3_IntroToQuest_Intro_009	<no>But we can talk more about that tomorrow.
GENERIC/Quest_3_IntroToQuest_Intro_010	<yes>For now, check out the journal.
GENERIC/Quest_3_IntroToQuest_Intro_011	<shocked>I think you’ll find that you’ve actually completed some of the milestones inside.
GENERIC/Quest_3_IntroToQuest_Intro_012	So be sure to claim them. <glee>
GENERIC/Quest_3_IntroToQuest_Intro_013	<yes>Now, are you hungry? I am.
GENERIC/Quest_3_IntroToQuest_Intro_014	<haha>I think it's just about lunch time.
GENERIC/Quest_3_IntroToQuest_Intro_015	<glee>I’ve seen fruit growing around this island and that sounds tasty!
GENERIC/Quest_3_IntroToQuest_Intro_016	<yes>You go and find us some fruit and when you get back I will show you how to craft a <itemName>.
GENERIC/Quest_3_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Intro_000	<PlayerName>. How goes the tucker hunting?
GENERIC/Quest_3_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_000	Where can I find fruit?
GENERIC/Quest_3_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_001	Not yet.
GENERIC/Quest_3_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_000	I did see some fruit trees growing inland a bit on our ride over <IslandName>.
GENERIC/Quest_3_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_001	It usually grows on smaller trees and shrubs.
GENERIC/Quest_3_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_002	Just try shaking any tree you you can!
GENERIC/Quest_3_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_003	If I remember correctly there are different fruits all over the island.
GENERIC/Quest_3_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_004	Good luck mate, looking forward to it! <glee>
GENERIC/Quest_3_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_001_000	That's okay!
GENERIC/Quest_3_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_001_001	<haha>Old <myName> will be waiting here for you!
GENERIC/Quest_4_CompleteQuest_Intro_000	Ah, goodmorning <PlayerName>!
GENERIC/Quest_4_CompleteQuest_Intro_001	Did you happen to see that <NPCName> has set up his tent at the Visitor's Site?
GENERIC/Quest_4_CompleteQuest_Intro_002	<yes>I told him all about you and how you’ve helped us get started here.
GENERIC/Quest_4_CompleteQuest_Intro_003	<haha>He sounded impressed!
GENERIC/Quest_4_CompleteQuest_Intro_004	John trades all sorts of things back to <SouthCity>.
GENERIC/Quest_4_CompleteQuest_Intro_005	I reckon nearly anything you can find on this island will be valuable to him.
GENERIC/Quest_4_CompleteQuest_Intro_006	He’ll buy fruit, fish, bugs and even rocks! <yes>
GENERIC/Quest_4_CompleteQuest_Intro_007	<NPCName> also sells a lot of useful tools.
GENERIC/Quest_4_CompleteQuest_Intro_008	He’s got mining equipment, logging tools and even some fishing equipment.
GENERIC/Quest_4_CompleteQuest_Intro_009	<thinking>Although, probably can't sell you a lot of tools until you have all your <Licences> in order.
GENERIC/Quest_4_CompleteQuest_Intro_010	You know about <Licences>, right?
GENERIC/Quest_4_CompleteQuest_Option_000	No I don’t.
GENERIC/Quest_4_CompleteQuest_Option_001	Yes I do.
GENERIC/Quest_4_CompleteQuest_Response_000_000	<Licences> are an old <SouthCity> idea!
GENERIC/Quest_4_CompleteQuest_Response_000_001	I’ll tell you what, you didn’t need a <Licence> for anything back when I was growing up!
GENERIC/Quest_4_CompleteQuest_Response_000_002	<no>But these days, you need a <Licence> for everything.
GENERIC/Quest_4_CompleteQuest_Response_000_003	Luckily I’m actually an accredited <Licence> Giver! <proud>
GENERIC/Quest_4_CompleteQuest_Response_000_004	If you want to apply for a <Licence> come and talk to me. <yes>
GENERIC/Quest_4_CompleteQuest_Response_000_005	You’ll have to spend some <PermitPoints> to get them, but if you keep doing milestones you’ll make enough in no time.
GENERIC/Quest_4_CompleteQuest_Response_000_006	As you get better at doing certain tasks, new <Licence> levels will open up too.
GENERIC/Quest_4_CompleteQuest_Response_000_007	Now, let’s see if there is a <Licence> you can apply for right now...
GENERIC/Quest_4_CompleteQuest_Response_001_000	That's great!
GENERIC/Quest_4_CompleteQuest_Response_001_001	I’ll tell you what, you didn’t need a <Licence> for anything back when I was growing up!
GENERIC/Quest_4_CompleteQuest_Response_001_002	<no>But these days, you need a <Licence> for everything.
GENERIC/Quest_4_CompleteQuest_Response_001_003	Luckily I’m actually an accredited <Licence> Giver! <proud>
GENERIC/Quest_4_CompleteQuest_Response_001_004	If you want to apply for a <Licence> come and talk to me. <yes>
GENERIC/Quest_4_CompleteQuest_Response_001_005	You’ll have to spend some <PermitPoints> to get them, but if you keep doing milestones you’ll make enough in no time.
GENERIC/Quest_4_CompleteQuest_Response_001_006	As you get better at doing certain tasks, new <Licence> levels will open up too.
GENERIC/Quest_4_CompleteQuest_Response_001_007	Now, let’s see if there is a <Licence> you can apply for right now...
GENERIC/Quest_4_IntroToQuest_Intro_000	I’m very impressed with the work you’ve done here today, <PlayerName>.
GENERIC/Quest_4_IntroToQuest_Intro_001	<proud>I think there is a great future for us all here at <IslandName>.
GENERIC/Quest_4_IntroToQuest_Intro_002	<shy>Here is a gift for helping me out so much.
GENERIC/Quest_4_IntroToQuest_Intro_003	It's a <itemName>!
GENERIC/Quest_4_IntroToQuest_Intro_004	I think you should take the rest of the day off.
GENERIC/Quest_4_IntroToQuest_Intro_005	Maybe you could go catch some of the bugs around here?
GENERIC/Quest_4_IntroToQuest_Intro_006	Or maybe you could cook some of that fruit you found?
GENERIC/Quest_4_IntroToQuest_Option_000	I'll figure out something to do...
GENERIC/Quest_4_IntroToQuest_Option_001	I'm ready for bed!
GENERIC/Quest_4_IntroToQuest_Response_000_000	<haha>I’m sure you will! 
GENERIC/Quest_4_IntroToQuest_Response_000_001	Oh and before I forget, take this <itemName> too.
GENERIC/Quest_4_IntroToQuest_Response_000_002	When you get tired, pop that on the ground and have a lay down.
GENERIC/Quest_4_IntroToQuest_Response_000_003	<haha>I'll tell you what, a good nights rest will do us both good!
GENERIC/Quest_4_IntroToQuest_Response_000_004	Thanks for your help today, <PlayerName>.
GENERIC/Quest_4_IntroToQuest_Response_000_005	I can't believe we're on <IslandName>!
GENERIC/Quest_4_IntroToQuest_Response_000_006	<glee>I couldn't have done any of this without you!
GENERIC/Quest_4_IntroToQuest_Response_001_000	<haha>I'm tired too!
GENERIC/Quest_4_IntroToQuest_Response_001_001	Here, take this <itemName>.
GENERIC/Quest_4_IntroToQuest_Response_001_002	If you are tired, pop that on the ground and have a lay down.
GENERIC/Quest_4_IntroToQuest_Response_001_003	<haha>I'll tell you what, a good nights rest will do us both good!
GENERIC/Quest_4_IntroToQuest_Response_001_004	Thanks for your help today, <PlayerName>.
GENERIC/Quest_4_IntroToQuest_Response_001_005	I can't believe we're on <IslandName>!
GENERIC/Quest_4_IntroToQuest_Response_001_006	<glee>I couldn't have done any of this without you!
GENERIC/Quest_4_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Intro_000	We've done some good work today, <PlayerName>!
GENERIC/Quest_4_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Intro_001	Take the rest of the day off! 
GENERIC/Quest_4_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Intro_002	<yes>We've got more work to do tomorrow!
GENERIC/Quest_4_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_000	About food?
GENERIC/Quest_4_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_001	Crafting a fire?
GENERIC/Quest_4_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_002	Cooking at a fire?
GENERIC/Quest_4_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_003	Bug hunting?
GENERIC/Quest_4_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_004	Sleeping?
GENERIC/Quest_4_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_005	I'm on it!
GENERIC/Quest_4_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_001_000	Feel free to use the <itemName> in the Base Tent whenever you want.
GENERIC/Quest_4_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_001_001	I'll tell you what, I'm sure you'll learn how to craft lots of useful things here on <IslandName>!
GENERIC/Quest_4_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_002_000	Once you've got your <itemName> going, just put the item you want to cook into your hands.
GENERIC/Quest_4_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_002_001	<yes>Then all that's left to do it pop it on and wait!
GENERIC/Quest_4_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_002_002	<thinking>You'll want to eat a lot of food to keep your energy up!
GENERIC/Quest_4_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_003_000	There are a lot of bugs found only here on <IslandName>.
GENERIC/Quest_4_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_003_001	<yes>Everytime you catch a new one it will be added to your Pedia. 
GENERIC/Quest_4_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_003_002	Maybe you could challenge yourself to find them all?
GENERIC/Quest_4_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_004_000	<haha>If you're ready for tomorrow, then sleeping will definetly bring tomorrow here faster!
GENERIC/Quest_4_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_004_001	Just pop your <itemName> down on the floor.
GENERIC/Quest_4_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_004_002	<yes>Wherever is fine, really.
GENERIC/Quest_4_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_004_003	<no>If you want to sleep under the stars, I'm not going to stop you.
GENERIC/Quest_4_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_005_000	Thanks again for your help, <PlayerName>!
GENERIC/Quest_5_CompleteQuest_Intro_000	Oh! So you bought the <itemName>! þ
GENERIC/Quest_5_CompleteQuest_Intro_001	Well done, <PlayerName>!
GENERIC/Quest_5_CompleteQuest_Intro_002	Don't you think having <NPCName> here is great?
GENERIC/Quest_5_CompleteQuest_Intro_003	<thinking>If only we could  convince <NPCName> to move here permanently...
GENERIC/Quest_5_CompleteQuest_Intro_004	<thinking>Hmmmm...
GENERIC/Quest_5_CompleteQuest_Intro_005	<haha>Well, let's worry about getting the materials needed for a permanent building first!
GENERIC/Quest_5_CompleteQuest_Intro_006	The <itemName> is a great first step!
GENERIC/Quest_5_CompleteQuest_Intro_007	For now, you can have a break.
GENERIC/Quest_5_CompleteQuest_Intro_008	<yes>Come back and talk to me when you are ready.
GENERIC/Quest_5_IntroToQuest_Intro_000	Oh, <PlayerName>. I almost forgot!
GENERIC/Quest_5_IntroToQuest_Intro_001	I noticed <NPCName> is selling a <itemName>.
GENERIC/Quest_5_IntroToQuest_Intro_002	That’s a tool I think will be very handy, indeed!
GENERIC/Quest_5_IntroToQuest_Intro_003	I think we should try and make enough money to buy a <itemName> from <NPCName>.
GENERIC/Quest_5_IntroToQuest_Intro_004	Here is my half of the Dinks. The rest is up to you! 
GENERIC/Quest_5_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Intro_000	How goes the money making, <PlayerName>.
GENERIC/Quest_5_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Intro_001	Have you earned enough to buy that <itemName> we need?
GENERIC/Quest_5_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_000	I want to apply for a licence.
GENERIC/Quest_5_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_001	How do I make money?
GENERIC/Quest_5_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_002	How do I get permit points?
GENERIC/Quest_5_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_003	Still a bit to go.
GENERIC/Quest_5_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_000	Okay, here you go.
GENERIC/Quest_5_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_001_000	<NPCName> will buy pretty much anything from you.
GENERIC/Quest_5_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_001_001	He will buy most of the things you can find around the island. Fruit, rocks, wood and all sorts of things.
GENERIC/Quest_5_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_001_002	<no>Now, you don't have to buy the <itemName> right away.
GENERIC/Quest_5_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_001_003	<haha>Feel free to buy any tools you think might make you money even quicker!
GENERIC/Quest_5_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_002_000	You can get <PermitPoints> by completing the daily tasks in your journal.
GENERIC/Quest_5_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_002_001	<yes>You'll also get a big lump of points by beating one of my Dad's milestones.
GENERIC/Quest_5_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_002_002	<proud>My Dad did a lot of different things, so you'll find there are milestones for everything!
GENERIC/Quest_5_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_002_003	If you just go about your day doing your activites, I'm sure you'll get rewarded eventually!
GENERIC/Quest_5_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_003_000	Keep it up, we're well on our way of making <IslandName> even better!
GENERIC/Quest_6_CompleteQuest_Intro_000	Well done, <PlayerName>!
GENERIC/Quest_6_CompleteQuest_Intro_001	<glee>I knew I could count on you to find everything we need!
GENERIC/Quest_6_CompleteQuest_Intro_002	Here is a recipe for a <itemName>.
GENERIC/Quest_6_CompleteQuest_Intro_003	Now why don't you try crafting the <itemName> at the crafting table in the base tent?þ
GENERIC/Quest_6_CompleteQuest_Intro_004	<yes>Once you've crafted the <itemName>, pop it on the ground outside somewhere.
GENERIC/Quest_6_CompleteQuest_Intro_005	Then, just place the ore inside of it.
GENERIC/Quest_6_CompleteQuest_Intro_006	It will take a little while to do its thing, so feel free to do some other activities while it's melting.
GENERIC/Quest_6_CompleteQuest_Intro_007	Bring me the Tin Bar when you're ready, okay?
GENERIC/Quest_6_IntroToQuest_Intro_000	<shy>I’ve got another job for you, <PlayerName>.þ
GENERIC/Quest_6_IntroToQuest_Intro_001	 You up for it?
GENERIC/Quest_6_IntroToQuest_Option_000	I'm ready!
GENERIC/Quest_6_IntroToQuest_Option_001	I want to apply for a licence.
GENERIC/Quest_6_IntroToQuest_Option_002	Not yet.
GENERIC/Quest_6_IntroToQuest_Response_000_000	I'll tell you what, I think camping is fun!
GENERIC/Quest_6_IntroToQuest_Response_000_001	<yes>But if we’re going convince people to stay here on <IslandName> we’ve gotta start building more permanent structures.
GENERIC/Quest_6_IntroToQuest_Response_000_002	<thinking>I’ve noticed there is a lot of <itemName> on this island. I’ve seen it popping out of rocks all over the place.
GENERIC/Quest_6_IntroToQuest_Response_000_003	<proud>I know a way we can melt down <itemName> into stuff great for building.
GENERIC/Quest_6_IntroToQuest_Response_000_004	Now, I'll need you to bring me some items.
GENERIC/Quest_6_IntroToQuest_Response_000_005	We'll need <questRequiredItems>.
GENERIC/Quest_6_IntroToQuest_Response_000_006	Keep in mind, you will need a <MiningLicence> to buy a pickaxe to collect ore and rocks.
GENERIC/Quest_6_IntroToQuest_Response_000_007	<proud>Once you’ve gathered everything we need, come and see me!
GENERIC/Quest_6_IntroToQuest_Response_001_000	Let's have a look then.
GENERIC/Quest_6_IntroToQuest_Response_002_000	<yes>Righto.
GENERIC/Quest_6_IntroToQuest_Response_002_001	You've been helping out a lot, so take your time, <PlayerName>.
GENERIC/Quest_6_IntroToQuest_Response_002_002	<glee>Just come back and see me when you're ready.
GENERIC/Quest_6_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Intro_000	<PlayerName>! How is the search going?
GENERIC/Quest_6_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Intro_001	Have you found all those items we need?
GENERIC/Quest_6_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_000	What do I need again?
GENERIC/Quest_6_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_001	Where can I get a campfire?
GENERIC/Quest_6_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_002	I want to apply for a licence.
GENERIC/Quest_6_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_003	I'm still looking.
GENERIC/Quest_6_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_000	We need <questRequiredItems>.
GENERIC/Quest_6_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_001	I’ve seen <itemName> here and there on the island. It's a dark ore poking out of rocks.
GENERIC/Quest_6_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_002	Your going to need a <MiningLicence> to buy a pickaxe to collect ore.
GENERIC/Quest_6_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_001_000	You're going to need to craft a <itemName> at the crafting table in the Base Tent.
GENERIC/Quest_6_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_001_001	Oh! And Your going to need a <MiningLicence> to buy a pickaxe to collect the stone to craft the <itemName>.
GENERIC/Quest_6_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_002_000	Let's have a look...
GENERIC/Quest_6_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_003_000	All right, mate. Keep your eyes peeled!
GENERIC/Quest_7_CompleteQuest_Intro_000	<glee>Well done, <PlayerName>.
GENERIC/Quest_7_CompleteQuest_Intro_001	<yes>You have proven yourself invaluable once again!
GENERIC/Quest_7_CompleteQuest_Intro_002	<shocked>You're really starting to carry a lot of stuff around!
GENERIC/Quest_7_CompleteQuest_Intro_003	<yes>I'll tell you what, I'll teach you how to craft a <itemName>.
GENERIC/Quest_7_CompleteQuest_Intro_004	<yes>You're going to need a recipe for Nails too.
GENERIC/Quest_7_CompleteQuest_Intro_005	<proud>I'll tell you what, <IslandName> is well on it's way to being a great settlement again!
GENERIC/Quest_7_CompleteQuest_Intro_006	<yes>With a furnace and a table saw we can start thinking about building more permanent structures.
GENERIC/Quest_7_CompleteQuest_Intro_007	I'll tell you what, we should try and get <NPCName> to set up a real shop here!
GENERIC/Quest_7_CompleteQuest_Option_000	Let's do it!
GENERIC/Quest_7_CompleteQuest_Option_001	How do we do that?
GENERIC/Quest_7_CompleteQuest_Response_000_000	That's the spirit, <PlayerName>!
GENERIC/Quest_7_CompleteQuest_Response_000_001	<yes>I reckon if we spend a bit of money at his tent, he'll see it's worth while...
GENERIC/Quest_7_CompleteQuest_Response_000_002	<yes>Oh, and we should show him how friendly people are around here!
GENERIC/Quest_7_CompleteQuest_Response_000_003	Why don't you ask <NPCName> if he has anything he needs done?
GENERIC/Quest_7_CompleteQuest_Response_000_004	<haha>If we can prove to him that <IslandName> is a great place to move, I'm sure he'll ask to live here for good!
GENERIC/Quest_7_CompleteQuest_Response_001_000	<thinking>Hmmmm....
GENERIC/Quest_7_CompleteQuest_Response_001_001	<yes>I reckon if we spend a bit of money at his shop, he'll see it's worth while...
GENERIC/Quest_7_CompleteQuest_Response_001_002	<yes>Oh, and we should show him how friendly people are around here!
GENERIC/Quest_7_CompleteQuest_Response_001_003	Why don't you ask <NPCName> if he has anything he needs done?
GENERIC/Quest_7_CompleteQuest_Response_001_004	<haha>If we can prove to him that <IslandName> is a great place to move, I'm sure he'll ask to live here for good!
GENERIC/Quest_7_IntroToQuest_Intro_000	I’ve got another job for you! You up for it?þ
GENERIC/Quest_7_IntroToQuest_Option_000	I'm ready!
GENERIC/Quest_7_IntroToQuest_Option_001	Not yet.
GENERIC/Quest_7_IntroToQuest_Response_000_000	If we are going to build anything around here we’re going to need materials.þ
GENERIC/Quest_7_IntroToQuest_Response_000_001	I reckon we need to wood and Tin. þ
GENERIC/Quest_7_IntroToQuest_Response_000_002	Now, wood? That’s easy. You chop down a tree and then you’ve got some wood.þ <yes>
GENERIC/Quest_7_IntroToQuest_Response_000_003	But Tin? That’s a bit trickier. I’ve seen it around the island poking out of rocks here and there. It’s a dark ore. You’ll know it if you see it.<yes>
GENERIC/Quest_7_IntroToQuest_Response_000_004	Now, we’re going to need to smelt it down into bars before we can use the Tin Ore for building things. <thinking>
GENERIC/Quest_7_IntroToQuest_Response_000_005	Go give the island a bit of a looky-loo for <questRequiredItems>.
GENERIC/Quest_7_IntroToQuest_Response_000_006	Bring them back here and I'll show you how we can turn Tin Ore into bars. <glee>
GENERIC/Quest_7_IntroToQuest_Response_001_000	Righto then.
GENERIC/Quest_7_IntroToQuest_Response_001_001	Come see me soon, okay?
GENERIC/Quest_7_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Intro_000	Hi there, <PlayerName>
GENERIC/Quest_7_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Intro_001	Have you managed to get a <itemName>?
GENERIC/Quest_7_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_000	I want to apply for a licence.
GENERIC/Quest_7_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_001	How do I craft a Furnace?
GENERIC/Quest_7_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_002	How do I make a Tin Bar?
GENERIC/Quest_7_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_003	I'm on it.
GENERIC/Quest_7_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_000	Alright then...
GENERIC/Quest_7_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_001_000	You can craft the <itemName> at the Crafting Table in the Base Tent.
GENERIC/Quest_7_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_001_001	You should have everything you need!
GENERIC/Quest_7_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_002_000	Once you've got your furnace, place it somewhere outside.
GENERIC/Quest_7_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_002_001	Then, all you have to do then is hold the <itemName> in your hands and pop it in!
GENERIC/Quest_7_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_002_002	<haha>Oh, and you'll have to wait a bit!
GENERIC/Quest_7_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_003_000	No worries, <PlayerName>.
GENERIC/Quest_7_TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_003_001	Just be sure to bring me the <itemName> once you have it!
GENERIC/Quest_8_Convo_Complete_Intro_000	<PlayerName>! 
GENERIC/Quest_8_Convo_Complete_Intro_001	<pumped>You did it!
GENERIC/Quest_8_Convo_Complete_Intro_002	Looks like <NPCName>’s shop is all built!
GENERIC/Quest_8_Convo_Complete_Intro_003	Now, we’re definitely on our way to become an official settlement.
GENERIC/Quest_8_Convo_Complete_Intro_004	<glee>Well done, mate!
GENERIC/Quest_TalkAboutFoodIntro_Intro_000	What did you want to know about food?
GENERIC/Quest_TalkAboutFoodIntro_Option_000	Stamina
GENERIC/Quest_TalkAboutFoodIntro_Option_001	Health
GENERIC/Quest_TalkAboutFoodIntro_Option_002	Fullness
GENERIC/Quest_TalkAboutFoodIntro_Option_003	Sitting
GENERIC/Quest_TalkAboutFoodIntro_Option_004	Nevermind
GENERIC/Quest_TalkAboutFoodIntro_Response_000_000	Hard yakka requires stamina!
GENERIC/Quest_TalkAboutFoodIntro_Response_000_001	That means, for every task you do, you’ll use up your stamina.
GENERIC/Quest_TalkAboutFoodIntro_Response_000_002	So, it's a good idea to eat before you do tasks. 
GENERIC/Quest_TalkAboutFoodIntro_Response_000_003	<proud>That will help keep your stamina up.
GENERIC/Quest_TalkAboutFoodIntro_Response_000_004	<shy>Some foods offer more stamina than others, but you’ll get the hang of that.
GENERIC/Quest_TalkAboutFoodIntro_Response_000_005	<worried>If you run out of stamina, you’re going to get tired.
GENERIC/Quest_TalkAboutFoodIntro_Response_000_006	<yes>You’ll be sluggish and slow until your stamina recovers.
GENERIC/Quest_TalkAboutFoodIntro_Response_000_007	So keep your belly full of stamina foods and you’ll be right.
GENERIC/Quest_TalkAboutFoodIntro_Response_001_000	<yes>It can be dangerous out there on <IslandName>.
GENERIC/Quest_TalkAboutFoodIntro_Response_001_001	<glee>So if you feel your health is low, it's a good idea to keep your belly full of healthy foods.
GENERIC/Quest_TalkAboutFoodIntro_Response_001_002	These foods will slowly restore your health.
GENERIC/Quest_TalkAboutFoodIntro_Response_001_003	<yes>You’ll learn what foods are good for restoring health, I’m sure.
GENERIC/Quest_TalkAboutFoodIntro_Response_001_004	<thinking>If you need to restore health quickly, you can always take a seat and recoup.
GENERIC/Quest_TalkAboutFoodIntro_Response_001_005	<yes>Your health will recover much quicker from food if you are sitting down.
GENERIC/Quest_TalkAboutFoodIntro_Response_002_000	Your belly can only hold so much, <PlayerName>.
GENERIC/Quest_TalkAboutFoodIntro_Response_002_001	So it’s a good idea to choose the foods you want to eat wisely.
GENERIC/Quest_TalkAboutFoodIntro_Response_002_002	Every type of food has its own benefits.
GENERIC/Quest_TalkAboutFoodIntro_Response_002_003	You’re going to want to make sure you get a well balanced diet for any task you want to tackle.
GENERIC/Quest_TalkAboutFoodIntro_Response_002_004	If you're full, but you want to make yourself not full, you can always craft a <itemName> and take a seat.
GENERIC/Quest_TalkAboutFoodIntro_Response_002_005	That will empty your belly allowing you to choose a different meal to eat.
GENERIC/Quest_TalkAboutFoodIntro_Response_003_000	If you’re low on health, and eat healthy food, your health will slowly recover.
GENERIC/Quest_TalkAboutFoodIntro_Response_003_001	However, you can speed up health recovery by taking a seat after eating.
GENERIC/Quest_TalkAboutFoodIntro_Response_003_002	<haha>Think of it like your body digesting all that healthy goodness!
GENERIC/Quest_TalkAboutFoodIntro_Response_003_003	
GENERIC/Quest_TalkAboutFoodIntro_Response_004_000	<yes>Righto.
GENERIC/RequestItem_Incorrect_1_Intro_000	Oh...
GENERIC/RequestItem_Incorrect_1_Intro_001	I actually wanted <requestItem>.
GENERIC/RequestItem_Incorrect_1_Intro_002	I'll give this back.
GENERIC/SellItemByWeight_Intro_000	Ah, I see you've got a nice <sellByWeightName> there.
GENERIC/SellItemByWeight_Intro_001	Looks like it weighs around <getItemWeight>!
GENERIC/SellItemByWeight_Intro_002	How does <getItemByWeightPrice> sound for it?
GENERIC/SellItemByWeight_Option_000	Yes
GENERIC/SellItemByWeight_Option_001	No
GENERIC/SellItemByWeight_Response_000_000	Thank you very much!
GENERIC/SellItemByWeight_Response_001_000	No worries, mate.
GENERIC/ShipmentRequestComplete_Intro_000	Wow! You really got the shipment ready for me?

GENERIC/StopFollowing_Response_000_001	Thanks for hanging out with me, <PlayerName>.
GENERIC/StopFollowing_Response_001_000	Let's go!
GENERIC/TradeCompleteConvo_Intro_000	Oh, you're interested in my <BulletinBoardReward> ?
GENERIC/TradeCompleteConvo_Option_000	I want to trade.
GENERIC/TradeCompleteConvo_Option_001	No thank you.

GENERIC/TuckshopConversation_Option_002	Nevermind
GENERIC/TuckshopConversation_Response_000_000	<yes>Well, today I'm paying top <Dink> for <itemName>.
GENERIC/TuckshopConversation_Response_002_000	See you around, <PlayerName>.
GENERIC/TuckshopMoveInRequest_Intro_000	You know what <PlayerName>?þ
GENERIC/TuckshopMoveInRequest_Intro_001	<shy>You’ve really shown me some of the great cuisine that can be created here on <IslandName>.þ
GENERIC/TuckshopMoveInRequest_Intro_002	<yes>I reckon it’s finally time to leave <SouthCity> for good.þ
GENERIC/TuckshopMoveInRequest_Intro_003	<proud>I’ve talked to <NPCName> and I’ve applied for a <itemName>.þ
GENERIC/TuckshopMoveInRequest_Intro_004	<glee>I hope we can get it up and running soon.þ
GENERIC/UseTreasureMapOffIsland_Intro_000	Hmmm...
GENERIC/UseTreasureMapOffIsland_Intro_001	I've marked an X on my map!
GENERIC/UseTreasureMapOnMainIsland_Intro_000	Hmmm...
GENERIC/UseTreasureMapOnMainIsland_Intro_001	This map isn't for here...
GENERIC/Wrong Photo Convo_Intro_000	I mean, this is a nice photo, but it's not what I was looking for . . .
GENERIC/Wrong Photo Convo_Option_000	Let me try again.
GENERIC/Wrong Photo Convo_Option_001	Nevermind.
GENERIC/Wrong Photo Convo_Response_000_000	Oh, you have another photo?
GENERIC/Wrong Photo Convo_Response_001_000	No problems. Thanks for trying!
IRWIN/AlreadyAnimalInShop_Intro_000	<shocked>Oh wait!
IRWIN/AlreadyAnimalInShop_Intro_001	<yes>We've got an animal in here already waiting for you to take them to their new home...
IRWIN/AlreadyAnimalInShop_Intro_002	Why don't you take any animals in their boxes outside first?
IRWIN/AlreadyAnimalInShop_Intro_003	<glee>Then we can talk about giving them a new friend.
IRWIN/AnimalShopIntro_Intro_000	Welcome to Irwin's Barn. How can I help?
IRWIN/AnimalShopIntro_Option_000	I want to chat
IRWIN/AnimalShopIntro_Option_001	Nevermind
IRWIN/AnimalShopIntro_Response_001_000	Struth!
IRWIN/CompleteBirthday_000_Intro_000	Oh, mate.
IRWIN/CompleteBirthday_000_Intro_001	<pumped>This is bloody deadly!
IRWIN/CompleteBirthday_000_Intro_002	Best <birthday> ever, mate!
IRWIN/CompleteRequest_000_Intro_000	<glee>Wackadoo!
IRWIN/CompleteRequest_000_Intro_001	<thinking><PlayerName> pulls through again.
IRWIN/CompleteRequest_000_Intro_002	<glee>Thanks again, <PlayerName>!
IRWIN/CompleteRequest_000_Intro_003	<yes>I want you to take this as a reward!
IRWIN/ConfirmAnimalBought_Intro_000	This is so great!
IRWIN/ConfirmAnimalBought_Intro_001	Please take good care of <animalJustBoughtName>. <pumped>
IRWIN/ConfirmAnimalBought_Intro_002	I'm going to miss her! <boohoo>
IRWIN/Gossip_About_NPC_000_Intro_000	I think <NPCName> is such a sweetheart.þ
IRWIN/Gossip_About_NPC_000_Intro_001	<no>Plants are nice and all, but they just can’t appreciate you the way animals can.þ
IRWIN/Gossip_About_NPC_001_Intro_000	<yes><NPCName> is really open minded when it comes to purchases.
IRWIN/Gossip_About_NPC_001_Intro_001	<haha>That man will buy anything!þ
IRWIN/Gossip_About_NPC_002_Intro_000	<sigh>It can be a tough grind talking to <NPCName> sometimes...þ
IRWIN/Gossip_About_NPC_002_Intro_001	<yes>Must be tough for him being that much of a smarty pants, I reckon.þ
IRWIN/Gossip_About_NPC_002_Intro_002	I mean, I can only think about a couple of things at a time, and that’s enough!þ
IRWIN/Gossip_About_NPC_003_Intro_000	<shy>Hearing <NPCName> talk about his wife makes me a little weepy sometimes.þ
IRWIN/Gossip_About_NPC_003_Intro_001	<yes>Hopefully I’ll find somebody that special, one day.
IRWIN/Gossip_About_NPC_004_Intro_000	There’s some crazy styles over at <NPCName>'s shop!þ
IRWIN/Gossip_About_NPC_004_Intro_001	I’d love to dress up like a pirate, but I don’t wanna scare the <animalName>s!þ
IRWIN/Gossip_About_NPC_006_Intro_000	<NPCName> has been through so much, and it’s only made her stronger!þþ
IRWIN/Gossip_About_NPC_006_Intro_001	<yes>I think we could learn a lot from her.þ
IRWIN/Gossip_About_NPC_009_Intro_000	I keep trying to show off my animals to <NPCName>.
IRWIN/Gossip_About_NPC_009_Intro_001	That fella sure loves his critters!þ
IRWIN/Gossip_About_NPC_009_Intro_002	<haha>He doesn’t like ‘em up close though!þ
IRWIN/Gossip_About_NPC_010_Intro_000	I reckon if you dig deep enough, <NPCName>’s got a heart of solid gold.þ
IRWIN/Gossip_About_NPC_010_Intro_001	<haha>Maybe bring two shovels!þ
IRWIN/Introduction_007_Intro_000	G’day, mate! The name is <myName>.þ
IRWIN/Introduction_007_Intro_001	<thinking>You’re… don’t tell me!þ
IRWIN/Introduction_007_Intro_002	You’re <PlayerName>, right?þ Absolutely wonderful to meet you, mate!
IRWIN/Introduction_007_Intro_003	<haha>I’m <myName>! Oh, I already told you that, right?þ
IRWIN/Introduction_007_Intro_004	I’m visiting <IslandName> trying to find a home for some beautiful little creatures.þ
IRWIN/Introduction_007_Intro_005	If you have a <AnimalHandlingLicence> come by and talk to me.þ
IRWIN/Introduction_007_Intro_006	<glee>There’s nothing more bonza than looking after a beautiful little creature!þ
IRWIN/Introduction_007_Intro_007	<yes>I hope you can help me out, <PlayerName>.þ
IRWIN/IslandDayGreeting_AfterNoon_007_Intro_000	Oh, <PlayerName>.þ
IRWIN/IslandDayGreeting_AfterNoon_007_Intro_001	Isn’t today bonza!þ
IRWIN/IslandDayGreeting_AfterNoon_007_Intro_002	<glee>And <NPCName> still has a surprise for us!þ
IRWIN/IslandDayGreeting_AfterNoon_007_Intro_003	<dance>You bloody beauty!þ
IRWIN/IslandDayGreeting_Morning_007_Intro_000	<IslandDay>!þ
IRWIN/IslandDayGreeting_Morning_007_Intro_001	<dance>You bloody beauty!þ
IRWIN/IslandDayGreeting_Morning_007_Intro_002	<NPCName> is cooking up a <SnagSizzle>.þ
IRWIN/IslandDayGreeting_Morning_007_Intro_003	She told me she had a special <Snag> for everyone!
IRWIN/IslandDayGreeting_Night_007_Intro_000	<glee>The sky is lovely.þ
IRWIN/IslandDayGreeting_Night_007_Intro_001	<thinking>You reckon the animals around <IslandName> are bothered by it?þ
IRWIN/IslandDayGreeting_Night_007_Intro_002	<glee>I doubt it, they are probably loving it too.þ
IRWIN/IslandDayGreeting_Noon_007_Intro_000	What a rippa <IslandDay>!þ
IRWIN/IslandDayGreeting_Noon_007_Intro_001	<NPCName> made me a veggie <Snag>.þ
IRWIN/IslandDayGreeting_Noon_007_Intro_002	It’s bloody beautiful, mate.þ
IRWIN/IslandDayGreeting_Noon_007_Intro_003	She’s a tops, that <NPCName>.þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_000_Intro_000	<yes>Animals are great listeners. 
IRWIN/RandomConvo_000_Intro_001	<pumped>You can say whatever you want to them and they will barely interrupt you!
IRWIN/RandomConvo_001_Intro_000	Don’t you just think <animalName> are so cute!þþ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_001_Intro_001	They are so little and fluffy!þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_001_Intro_002	<glee>And the way they walk!þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_001_Intro_003	<pumped>Absolutely beautiful creatures!þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_002_Intro_000	You know about <animalName>? þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_002_Intro_001	Those animals are beautiful!þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_002_Intro_002	<glee>They’re so big, but so gentle.þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_002_Intro_003	<yes>They've got big hearts you know?þ Three of them in fact!þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_002_Intro_004	<haha>Absolutely amazing!þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_003_Intro_000	<animalName> wool is some of the softest wool in the world. þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_003_Intro_001	<haha>It might have something to do with the fact that it's nearly always wet.þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_003_Intro_002	<pumped>Crikey! þDo those critters love the water!þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_003_Intro_003	<glee>Absolutely beautiful creatures they are!þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_004_Intro_000	<animalName> make great companions. þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_004_Intro_001	<glee>They are loyal, loving and struth, are they cute.þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_004_Intro_002	Oh, and did I mention they are loyal?þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_004_Intro_003	<shy>I did?þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_004_Intro_004	<haha>Oh, what about how cute they are?þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_005_Intro_000	<no>I wasn’t really allowed to have any pets growing up in <SouthCity>.þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_005_Intro_001	<shy>I mean, I had some anyway.
IRWIN/RandomConvo_005_Intro_002	<haha>I just wasn’t really allowed to!þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_006_Intro_000	<pumped>The <animalName> you find up in the tropical parts of the island can be really fierce!þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_006_Intro_001	<yes>I'd keep my distance from their nests if I was you.þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_006_Intro_002	<pumped>They've got razor sharp claws and are just brimming with attitude!þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_007_Intro_000	<no>I don't get how some people don't like animals.
IRWIN/RandomConvo_007_Intro_001	What's not to like?
IRWIN/RandomConvo_007_Intro_002	Some are slimy, some are poisonous and some even have crackin big teeth! 
IRWIN/RandomConvo_007_Intro_003	<pumped>Struth! 
IRWIN/RandomConvo_007_Intro_004	<glee>I just love 'em all!þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_008_Intro_000	Have you ever gotten a gander of those <animalName>, mate?
IRWIN/RandomConvo_008_Intro_001	<yes>I’ve seen more than a few. 
IRWIN/RandomConvo_008_Intro_002	<haha>Crikey, they're real bruteys!þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_009_Intro_000	<no>A lot of people have told me that the <BlobFish> back in <SouthCity> was terrible.þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_009_Intro_001	<no>I never could bring myself to eat them.þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_009_Intro_002	<pumped>They are just too cute!þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_010_Intro_000	<proud>I reckon I’ve got one of the best noses in the world. þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_010_Intro_001	<yes>Everybody’s always telling me how good it is.
IRWIN/RandomConvo_010_Intro_002	They always say “<myName>, you really smell, mate”þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_011_Intro_000	<yes>I could watch animals all day long.
IRWIN/RandomConvo_011_Intro_001	<haha>They’re just always doing something, even when they’re not doing anything.
IRWIN/RandomConvo_011_Intro_002	<glee>Just spectacular!þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_012_Intro_000	<thinking>Hmmm, if I could choose to be any animal in the world, huh?þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_012_Intro_001	<thinking>I reckon, if I really thought about it... it would definitely have to be...
IRWIN/RandomConvo_012_Intro_002	<haha>A very tough decision.þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_013_Intro_000	<yes>Being a great animal handler is all about respect.
IRWIN/RandomConvo_013_Intro_001	<haha>Sometimes you’ve really got to respect the fact that some animals just do NOT wanna be handled.þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_014_Intro_000	It’s great here on <IslandName>!
IRWIN/RandomConvo_014_Intro_001	<glee>There are so many critters… crittering around!þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_014_Intro_002	<pumped>The place is crawling with life!þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_015_Intro_000	<SouthCity> didn’t really have any interesting wildlife, you know.þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_015_Intro_001	<thinking>Hmmm…þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_015_Intro_002	<haha>I guess some people find <BlobFish> interesting!þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_016_Intro_000	<yes>Growing up all I ever wanted to do was look after animals that were in need.þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_016_Intro_001	<glee>I don’t know what it is, but I just bloody love all creatures, great and small!þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_017_Intro_000	Don’t you just love being outdoors?
IRWIN/RandomConvo_017_Intro_001	The sun on your back, the wind in your hair.
IRWIN/RandomConvo_017_Intro_002	<glee>It’s bloody marvellous, mate.
IRWIN/RandomConvo_018_Intro_000	<thinking>A lot of what I know about animals is maybe a bit outdated these days..þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_018_Intro_001	I learnt it mostly through the books I found in <SouthCity>.þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_018_Intro_002	<yes>But seeing an animal in real life is totally different to reading about it in a book.þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_018_Intro_003	<thinking>I mean, the <animalName> I read about in books doesn’t even have horns!þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_019_Intro_000	<no>I’ve never been that fond of bugs.þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_019_Intro_001	They’re is just nothing cute about them!þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_019_Intro_002	<no>I just can’t see why so many people like to keep them as pets back in <SouthCity>.þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_019_Intro_003	<angry>Oh and they have too many legs!þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_020_Intro_000	I reckon I’ve had some real friendships with animals, <PlayerName>.þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_020_Intro_001	<sigh>But maybe they aren’t real friendships if they can’t talk back…þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_020_Intro_002	<shy>Maybe I need to talk to people more!þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_021_Intro_000	<animalName> milk is absolutely beautiful!þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_021_Intro_001	And it’s good for you too!þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_021_Intro_002	<pumped>That stuff will build up your bones really good!þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_022_Intro_000	<pumped><animalName> eggs are huge!þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_022_Intro_001	<yes>One of those can feed a whole family back in <SouthCity>.þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_022_Intro_002	<yes>That’s why people will pay top <Dink> for them.þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_022_Intro_003	<thinking>Although, they are super delicate and can be hard to transport.þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_023_Intro_000	<shocked><animalName> can breath fire, you know?þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_023_Intro_001	<pumped>They have a sac in the back of their throat that can spit a flammable liquid!þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_023_Intro_002	<thinking>Not quite sure how they light it up though!þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_023_Intro_003	<yes>They can be scary for sure, but I think they are beautiful animals in their own way!þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_024_Intro_000	<yes><animalName> horns can be valuable back in <SouthCity>.þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_024_Intro_001	<no>Posh people like to use them for cutlery handles and the like.þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_024_Intro_002	<no>Kinda gross if you ask me.þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_024_Intro_003	<yes>They’re better off just being left on their heads!þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_025_Intro_000	The one insect I can get behind is the humble <inventoryItem>.þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_025_Intro_001	<glee>Not only are they cute, but they make honey!þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_025_Intro_002	<haha>What a sweet thing for a bug to do!þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_026_Intro_000	<animalName> are funny little critters, don’t you think?þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_026_Intro_001	<haha>They’re slow even when they are trying to be fast.þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_026_Intro_002	Those little guys make me laugh when they run!þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_027_Intro_000	<animalName> have an absolutely beautiful song, don’t you think?þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_027_Intro_001	<glee>Those little guys sing their hearts out.þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_027_Intro_002	<thinking>I don’t think I’ve heard anything like it before, to be honest.þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_028_Intro_000	Hey <PlayerName>, thank you for being such a good friend!þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_028_Intro_001	<glee>You’re bloody bonza, you know that?þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_029_Intro_000	You’re a good friend, <PlayerName>.þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_029_Intro_001	I’m so glad I came here to <IslandName>.þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_029_Intro_002	<yes>I think my life has really changed for the better after meeting you.þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_030_Intro_000	I don’t think I’ve ever had a friend like you before, <PlayerName>.þþ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_030_Intro_001	<yes>I mean, I’ve had some good mates who were animals.þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_030_Intro_002	<shy>But it’s always good to have a mate that can chat back!þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_031_Intro_000	<yes>I’m constantly AMAZED by all the things animals can do.þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_031_Intro_001	<worried>Nature can be a bit harsh sometimes, or vicious!þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_031_Intro_002	<no>But it’s NEVER boring!þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_032_Intro_000	Do you think there are other places out there similar to <IslandName>?
IRWIN/RandomConvo_032_Intro_001	With all their own wildlife?
IRWIN/RandomConvo_032_Intro_002	<glee>I heard there were HUNDREDS of different types of animals before everything went South..
IRWIN/RandomConvo_032_Intro_003	<thinking>Maybe they survived somewhere?þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_032_Intro_004	<sigh>I sure hope so...
IRWIN/RandomConvo_033_Intro_000	Animals didn’t do anything to deserve the <Shifts>...þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_033_Intro_001	They were just minding their own business whilst people mucked everything up.þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_033_Intro_002	<no>It sucks that others have to pay for our mistakes...þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_033_Intro_003	<no>Thing is, I don’t think folk in <SouthCity> even know what they’re missing out on.þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_033_Intro_004	<pumped>Having a gander at all of this though, they’d be blown away, I reckon!
IRWIN/RandomConvo_034_Intro_000	<thinking>I’d love to have everything in one place one day.þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_034_Intro_001	Can you imagine that, <PlayerName>?þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_034_Intro_002	A few of each animal type from all over the world, in one location!þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_034_Intro_003	Not behind glass or cooped up or anything… we’d make proper enclosures and environments!þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_034_Intro_004	They’d have all the room they needed AND all of their favourite foods.þ
IRWIN/RandomConvo_034_Intro_005	<yes>Everybody would love to see that.
IRWIN/RandomConvo_034_Intro_006	I reckon we’d take better care of nature if everybody saw how beautiful it could be.

IRWIN/SkyFest_AfterNoon_007_Intro_001	<glee>This is maybe my best <Kite> ever!
IRWIN/SkyFest_AfterNoon_007_Intro_002	It soars just like a beautiful <animalName>!
IRWIN/SkyFest_AfterNoon_007_Intro_003	<glee>Totally grouse!
IRWIN/SkyFest_Morning_007_Intro_000	You beauty!
IRWIN/SkyFest_Morning_007_Intro_001	<dance>It’s <SkyFest>!
IRWIN/SkyFest_Morning_007_Intro_002	I’ve been waiting all year for this!
IRWIN/SkyFest_Night_007_Intro_000	It’s amazing to see the sky like this!
IRWIN/SkyFest_Night_007_Intro_001	<yes>I always love a good <SkyFest> celebration.
IRWIN/SkyFest_Night_007_Intro_002	<glee>But I reckon a <SkyFest> on <IslandName> will always be the best kind of <SkyFest>.
IRWIN/SkyFest_Noon_007_Intro_000	Struth!
IRWIN/SkyFest_Noon_007_Intro_001	I hope you’ve made your <Kite>, <PlayerName>!
IRWIN/SkyFest_Noon_007_Intro_002	I’ve made a beauty of a <Kite>.
IRWIN/SkyFest_Noon_007_Intro_003	Can’t wait to fly it around!
IRWIN/TownMention_Level_001_Intro_000	<IslandName> is well on the way to being a great place! þ
IRWIN/TownMention_Level_001_Intro_001	<yes>You should be very proud of yourself, <PlayerName>.þ
IRWIN/TownMention_Level_001_Intro_002	<glee>I hope you keep up the great work!þ
IRWIN/TownMention_Level_002_Intro_000	<IslandName> is changing for the better, and it’s all because of your hard work, <PlayerName>!
IRWIN/TownMention_Level_002_Intro_001	<glee>Thanks a bunch!
IRWIN/TownMention_Level_003_Intro_000	Struth, mate!
IRWIN/TownMention_Level_003_Intro_001	Have I told you how great <IslandName> is looking lately?þ
IRWIN/TownMention_Level_003_Intro_002	<pumped>You’ve obviously been putting a lot of work into making this town great, and it’s looking absolutely beautiful, mate!þ
IRWIN/TownMention_Level_004_Intro_000	<IslandName> is looking absolutely beautiful thanks to you, <PlayerName>.þ
IRWIN/TownMention_Level_004_Intro_001	It’s amazing the transformation that this place has gone under.þ
IRWIN/TownMention_Level_004_Intro_002	I can barely recognise the place.þ
IRWIN/TownMention_Level_004_Intro_003	<glee>I bloody love it here!þ
IRWIN/WantToBuyAnimalNoCoop_Intro_000	Oh! That's a <buyItemName>.
IRWIN/WantToBuyAnimalNoCoop_Intro_001	Shes a cutie, right?
IRWIN/WantToBuyAnimalNoCoop_Intro_002	If you've got a good home for her, she's all yours for <buyItemPrice>.
IRWIN/WantToBuyAnimalNoCoop_Option_000	I'll take it!
IRWIN/WantToBuyAnimalNoCoop_Option_001	No thanks.
IRWIN/WantToBuyAnimalNoCoop_Response_000_000	Oh great!<pumped>
IRWIN/WantToBuyAnimalNoCoop_Response_000_001	But you don't have an empty coop for her to stay in!
IRWIN/WantToBuyAnimalNoCoop_Response_000_002	A <buyItemName> like her needs a coop to stay safe. <yes>
IRWIN/WantToBuyAnimalNoCoop_Response_000_003	Craft a house for her and place it down somewhere. Once you've done that come back and speak to me. <yes>
IRWIN/WantToBuyAnimalNoCoop_Response_001_000	That's okay! I'm sure she'll find a home soon! <yes>
IRWIN/WantToBuyAnimalNoMoney_Intro_000	Oh! That's a <buyItemName>.
IRWIN/WantToBuyAnimalNoMoney_Intro_001	Shes a cutie, right?
IRWIN/WantToBuyAnimalNoMoney_Intro_002	If you've got a good home for her, she's all yours for <buyItemPrice>.
IRWIN/WantToBuyAnimalNoMoney_Option_000	I'll take it!
IRWIN/WantToBuyAnimalNoMoney_Option_001	No thanks.
IRWIN/WantToBuyAnimalNoMoney_Response_000_000	Oh great!<pumped>
IRWIN/WantToBuyAnimalNoMoney_Response_000_001	Wait, you don't have enough money... <shy>

JOHN/RandomConvo_000_Intro_002	<haha>But, they’re the best tools you can get on <IslandName>.þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_001_Intro_000	<proud>I've been doing some stocktake recently and everything is looking real good.þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_001_Intro_001	<haha>Better than good, it’s John’s Goods!þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_002_Intro_000	Are you wondering why I can buy bugs off you at such a high price?þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_002_Intro_001	Those things make great pets back in <SouthCity>.þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_002_Intro_002	<haha>And people are willing to pay a fortune for a pet that won't take up half their house!þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_003_Intro_000	The fish from this island are an incredible treat for those people back in <SouthCity>.þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_003_Intro_001	<haha>I mean, the only thing you can catch in <SouthCity> are <Blobfish>!þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_003_Intro_002	<haha>So eating anything else is always a treat!þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_004_Intro_000	<thinking>I’ve been trying to get rid of some excess stock recently. þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_004_Intro_001	<haha>The thing is, I already have the best deals in town, so I haven’t adjusted the prices. þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_005_Intro_000	<yes>Everything has a value to someone, you know. You just have to find the right people and the right price.þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_005_Intro_001	<haha>Luckily, the people in <SouthCity> don’t know how common things certain things are over here, so I can charge them a bit more!þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_006_Intro_000	You look a little down today, <PlayerName>.þ..
JOHN/RandomConvo_006_Intro_001	Have you considered buying something?
JOHN/RandomConvo_006_Intro_002	<yes>That always makes me feel better.
JOHN/RandomConvo_006_Intro_003	<haha>You, buying something, I mean.þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_007_Intro_000	I wouldn’t trade trading for anything. þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_007_Intro_001	<thinking>I mean… þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_007_Intro_002	<haha>Unless it was a really good deal!þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_008_Intro_000	The secret to trading is to buy low, and sell high.þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_008_Intro_001	<thinking>...þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_008_Intro_002	<sigh>I probably should’ve sold you that information…þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_009_Intro_000	I worked hard to get the <PermitPoints> I needed to get my <CommerceLicence>.þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_009_Intro_001	<haha>My brother back in <SouthCity> worked really hard to get me to give him some of my <PermitPoints> so he could get his too!þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_010_Intro_000	<sigh>I’ve got to make enough <Dinks> this month or my brother will be in trouble back in <SouthCity>.þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_010_Intro_001	<no>I won't raise prices or anything like that...þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_010_Intro_002	<haha>Just be sure to keep selling me stuff, okay, <PlayerName>?þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_011_Intro_000	Sometimes I don’t know when to stop, you know?þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_011_Intro_001	<haha>I’ve shipped so many bugs this season I can’t even keep track of them!þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_012_Intro_000	<PlayerName>, you and I make a great team. You run around, collecting rare and valuable things, I buy them from you.
JOHN/RandomConvo_012_Intro_001	<proud>For a very, vary fair price I might add.
JOHN/RandomConvo_012_Intro_002	Then I sell them onto my buyer in <SouthCity>.þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_012_Intro_003	<haha>This way, everyone gets <Dinks>!þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_013_Intro_000	It’s become very obvious that you are my favourite customer, <PlayerName>.þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_013_Intro_001	I would offer you a discount, but my brother is actually in a bit of debt at the moment, and he really needs the <Dinks>!þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_013_Intro_002	<haha>But just remember that I was thinking of it, okay?þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_014_Intro_000	<yes>The people in <SouthCity> are happy to eat anything that isn’t <BlobFish>.þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_014_Intro_001	<yes>So when they get to buy the exotic fish that can be found here on <IslandName>, they will pay top <Dink> for it!þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_015_Intro_000	þThat’s a fancy <Journal> you’ve got there.þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_015_Intro_001	<yes><NPCName> actually told me all about it.þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_015_Intro_002	<no>I can’t imagine how much it means to her.þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_015_Intro_003	<haha>She must really trust you, <PlayerName>!þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_016_Intro_000	My brother says he’s been spending a lot of time looking for new items to ship over to us here on <IslandName>.þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_016_Intro_001	<thinking>He assures me he’s been working a lot.þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_016_Intro_002	<yes>I hope he’s okay.þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_017_Intro_000	<shy>Thanks for doing so much business with me, <PlayerName>.þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_017_Intro_001	<haha>And remember, they ain’t good unless their John’s Goods!
JOHN/RandomConvo_018_Intro_000	I got a scale in my shop for weighing up any big items you can bring me. þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_018_Intro_001	<yes>Huge eggs and the like. þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_018_Intro_002	I’ll give you a great price for them, so it’s worth hauling them in if you can!þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_019_Intro_000	<thinking>You don’t talk too much, but your wallet does.
JOHN/RandomConvo_019_Intro_001	<yes>I really like that about you, <PlayerName>.
JOHN/RandomConvo_020_Intro_000	<yes>It’s nice to see you today, <PlayerName>.þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_020_Intro_001	<no>We don’t have to do a transaction today.þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_020_Intro_002	<yes>Having this discussion is nearly as nice as making some <Dinks>.þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_021_Intro_000	You know what <PlayerName>?þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_021_Intro_001	<yes>I wish my brother was more like you.þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_021_Intro_002	<yes>You work hard, you’re polite and you’re very kind. þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_021_Intro_003	<haha>He’s kind of ratbag sometimes!þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_022_Intro_000	<no>I’m sorry that the tools I sell break pretty often.þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_022_Intro_001	<thinking>I’ve asked my brother back in <SouthCity> to try and get higher quality products.þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_022_Intro_002	<shy>I guess he is just trying to make every <Dink> count...þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_023_Intro_000	<sigh>I wish I didn’t have to run my shop for so many hours a day.þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_023_Intro_001	<haha>But you know what they say, “If you aren’t open then you aren’t making <Dinks>”þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_023_Intro_002	<sigh>I could really use some time off though...þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_024_Intro_000	<sigh>Somebody asked me for a “Refund” the other day. þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_024_Intro_001	Can you believe that? They wanted ALL their dinks back!þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_024_Intro_002	I gave them half. Fair’s fair, I reckon.þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_024_Intro_003	<thinking> Hey, do you want half a shovel?þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_024_Option_000	No thanks
JOHN/RandomConvo_024_Option_001	Sure!
JOHN/RandomConvo_024_Response_000_000	Suit yourself
JOHN/RandomConvo_024_Response_001_000	<thinking>Hmmm… I think I’ll hold onto it for now.
JOHN/RandomConvo_024_Response_001_001	<no>I didn’t expect it to be in such high demand!
JOHN/RandomConvo_025_Intro_000	<no> Sometimes it can get quite lonely in my shop, working such long hours. þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_025_Intro_001	Luckily, I have hundreds and hundreds of items to keep me company.þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_025_Intro_002	<haha> Oh, and you, too! þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_025_Intro_003	Thanks for making time for me, <PlayerName>.
JOHN/RandomConvo_026_Intro_000	<no> Even if it’s an absolute bargain, it can be sad to part with your hard-earned <Dinks>.þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_026_Intro_001	But boy, the rush you get from a massive sale? There’s just nothing like it!þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_026_Intro_002	<haha>See, buying low and selling high isn’t just good trading advice, it’s also how I feel.
JOHN/RandomConvo_027_Intro_000	I might complain about working a fair bit, but truth is, I’m not sure what to do on my day off.þþ
JOHN/RandomConvo_027_Intro_001	Time spent not trying to make <Dinks> can feel wasted, don’t you think?þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_027_Option_000	I get it.
JOHN/RandomConvo_027_Option_001	Not really...
JOHN/RandomConvo_027_Option_002	I don't like to work to much.
JOHN/RandomConvo_027_Response_000_000	<haha>You might just be a born trader after all!
JOHN/RandomConvo_027_Response_001_000	<haha>I might believe you if you weren't here so much!þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_027_Response_002_000	<haha>Says the person buying up all my tools!
JOHN/RandomConvo_028_Intro_000	<IslandName> is really starting to feel like a home.
JOHN/RandomConvo_028_Intro_001	<haha>I reckon it is home now!
JOHN/RandomConvo_028_Intro_002	I love waking up and having a wander around my shop every morning.þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_028_Intro_003	And seeing you is always a treat too, <PlayerName>!
JOHN/RandomConvo_029_Intro_000	Sorry I’ve been running a bit late for work lately, <PlayerName>.
JOHN/RandomConvo_029_Intro_001	<shy>I know sometimes you're in there waiting for me…
JOHN/RandomConvo_029_Intro_002	<haha>I guess I just want to say thanks for waiting!
JOHN/RandomConvo_030_Intro_000	<glee>It’s always good talking to you <PlayerName>.þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_030_Intro_001	<haha>It almost makes me forget that I work 12 hour days, 6 days a week.þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_031_Intro_000	You know, I would love to give you more great deals, <PlayerName>.þþ
JOHN/RandomConvo_031_Intro_001	Mates rates, you know?þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_031_Intro_002	<glee>Because we’re good mates, right?
JOHN/RandomConvo_031_Intro_003	<sigh>Unfortunately, my brother says he really needs a big payment this month...
JOHN/RandomConvo_032_Intro_000	You’re a totally different person from when we met, <PlayerName>.þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_032_Intro_001	<haha>I mean, you’ve always been good at what you do, don’t get me wrong.þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_032_Intro_002	<yes>But I really feel like you’ve grown a lot since you helped me get set up here on <IslandName>.
JOHN/RandomConvo_033_Intro_000	<IslandName> feels like my home now.þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_033_Intro_001	<thinking>Sure, I sometimes miss <SouthCity>.þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_033_Intro_002	<haha>Although, if I ever went back, I would miss everyone here on <IslandName> a lot!
JOHN/RandomConvo_034_Intro_000	<yes>When my brother decided to move my business here we were taking a pretty big risk.
JOHN/RandomConvo_034_Intro_001	<yes>But I'm very glad he made that decision for me!
JOHN/RandomConvo_034_Intro_002	<glee>He doesn't know what he's missing here on <IslandName>!
JOHN/RandomConvo_035_Intro_000	Now that we’re friends, I feel like I can tell you a few trade secrets.þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_035_Intro_001	Listen, trading isn't JUST about getting a good deal you know.þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_035_Intro_002	<thinking>Oh, wait, I guess it is.þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_035_Intro_003	<yes>Yeah. Go for good deals.þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_035_Intro_004	<haha>Honestly, that's all there is to it.þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_036_Intro_000	<yes>In life, you’ve always got to decide what to hold on to and what to let go.þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_036_Intro_001	<thinking>There’s always a tradeoff… þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_036_Intro_002	<no>It wasn’t easy, moving here.þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_036_Intro_003	But taking a risk like this? And seeing everything work out like it has?þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_036_Intro_004	<proud>I got a feeling like it’s all gonna be worth it.þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_036_Intro_005	<yes>Just gotta keep working.þ One day at a time.þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_036_Intro_006	Thanks for listening, <PlayerName>.
JOHN/RandomConvo_037_Intro_000	<yes>You know, I grew this beard when I was a bit younger.
JOHN/RandomConvo_037_Intro_001	My brother asked if he could trade me something for my moustache.þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_037_Intro_002	I figured it would grow back, you know?þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_037_Intro_003	<sigh>It never did…
JOHN/RandomConvo_038_Intro_000	<no>You know, it doesn’t bother me too much working hard to help my brother.þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_038_Intro_001	<yes>He's a good guys, he just gets himself into trouble.þ
JOHN/RandomConvo_038_Intro_002	<no>Always saying things like “Lets make some deals, let’s trade some wheels”
JOHN/RandomConvo_039_Intro_000	<shy>My brother says he’s too busy to come and visit me here on <IslandName>.
JOHN/RandomConvo_039_Intro_001	<no>He’s got a boat, but he says he can’t even take it out for a quick visit.þ

MELVIN/RandomConvo_003_Intro_000	<yes>I like buildin’ things.þ
MELVIN/RandomConvo_003_Intro_001	<shy>Try to take my time with ‘em though.þ
MELVIN/RandomConvo_004_Intro_000	<thinking>Trees here on <IslandName> look like they have good wood for buildin’ things.
MELVIN/RandomConvo_005_Intro_000	<no>I reckon yer never too old to do anythin’.
MELVIN/RandomConvo_006_Intro_000	Yer always busy, ain’t ya <PlayerName>?

MELVIN/RandomConvo_010_Intro_001	<no>Place sounds horrid if you ask me.þ
MELVIN/RandomConvo_010_Intro_002	<thinking>The wife was from there though.þ
MELVIN/RandomConvo_010_Intro_003	<yes>She wasn’t half bad.þ
MELVIN/RandomConvo_011_Intro_000	Started makin’ things back as a boy.þ

MELVIN/RandomConvo_013_Intro_001	<no>Ain’t no reason to run around like a headless chook.þ
MELVIN/RandomConvo_014_Intro_000	When I’m buildin’ the whole world can melt away. þ
MELVIN/RandomConvo_014_Intro_001	Me wife once told me that she said that all the time...þ
MELVIN/RandomConvo_015_Intro_000	<proud>Nothing’ that I can’t sand, varnish, or whittle into somethin’ comfortable.
MELVIN/RandomConvo_015_Intro_001	<yes>It’ll take time, but, so do all the best things.þ
MELVIN/RandomConvo_016_Intro_000	Yer gotta feel things out when you are makin’ furniture.
MELVIN/RandomConvo_016_Intro_001	<thinking>Some things come out hard and functional. 
MELVIN/RandomConvo_016_Intro_002	<shy>Some come out soft and comfortable. 
MELVIN/RandomConvo_016_Intro_003	<haha>I can’t control what comes out, I just go with the grain.
MELVIN/RandomConvo_017_Intro_000	<thinking>Seen a lot of things in my time.þ

MELVIN/RandomConvo_021_Intro_000	<thinking>I swear I had a few <PermitPoints> saved up for somethin’.þ
MELVIN/RandomConvo_021_Intro_001	The wife used to look after that kind of stuff for me.þ
MELVIN/RandomConvo_021_Intro_002	<no>Who knows where they are now?þ
MELVIN/RandomConvo_022_Intro_000	Me great grandad helped set up <SouthCity> back in the old days.þ
MELVIN/RandomConvo_022_Intro_001	<no>I guess he wasn’t too keen on what they were doin’ there.þ
MELVIN/RandomConvo_022_Intro_002	<yes>Got out of there just in time I reckon.þ
MELVIN/RandomConvo_023_Intro_000	The best thing about bein’ an old fella?
MELVIN/RandomConvo_023_Intro_001	Bein’ able to nap whenever you want.þ
MELVIN/RandomConvo_023_Intro_002	Can’t beat them quality winks.
MELVIN/RandomConvo_024_Intro_000	Routine is a fine thing to have.þ
MELVIN/RandomConvo_024_Intro_001	<yes>You should find a groove.þ
MELVIN/RandomConvo_024_Intro_002	I know I got mine.þ
MELVIN/RandomConvo_025_Intro_000	<no>I don’t much care for them artifacts.þ
MELVIN/RandomConvo_025_Intro_001	Fine craftin’, but not one lick o’ wood in ‘em.þ
MELVIN/RandomConvo_025_Intro_002	Still, to just leave em lyin around like that?þ
MELVIN/RandomConvo_025_Intro_003	<no>It ain’t right.
MELVIN/RandomConvo_026_Intro_000	I was thinkin’ of me company name.þ
MELVIN/RandomConvo_026_Intro_001	<thinking>Somethin’ snappy to put on the box.þ
MELVIN/RandomConvo_026_Intro_002	<thinking>I’m <NPCName>, and I make furniture.þ
MELVIN/RandomConvo_026_Intro_003	So I went with “<NPCName> Furniture”.þ
MELVIN/RandomConvo_027_Intro_000	Feels like the seasons get shorter every year.þ
MELVIN/RandomConvo_027_Intro_001	Days get longer though.þ
MELVIN/RandomConvo_027_Intro_002	Life’s a funny old thing.þ
MELVIN/RandomConvo_028_Intro_000	Look at us, eh?þ
MELVIN/RandomConvo_028_Intro_001	Just two mates. þ

MELVIN/RandomConvo_030_Intro_001	<yes>They're not long. Just the way I enjoy 'em.þ
MELVIN/RandomConvo_031_Intro_000	The wife would have liked ya, <PlayerName>.þ
MELVIN/RandomConvo_031_Intro_001	<yes>She liked people who knew what they wanted.þ
MELVIN/RandomConvo_032_Intro_000	<IslandName> is a great place ain’t it?þ

MELVIN/RandomConvo_034_Intro_000	Nice to see ya, <PlayerName>.þ
MELVIN/RandomConvo_034_Intro_001	<thinking>I was thinking of taking a break today.þ
MELVIN/RandomConvo_034_Intro_002	<no>No need to push yerself.þ
MELVIN/RandomConvo_035_Intro_000	I tell ya, if I had my time all over again?þ
MELVIN/RandomConvo_035_Intro_001	<no>I wouldn’t change a thing.
MELVIN/RandomConvo_036_Intro_000	<yes>I know I can always count on you to do what needs doin’.þ
MELVIN/RandomConvo_036_Intro_001	<no>Not everyone’s like that.þ

MILBURN/BankConversation_Intro_000	Welcome to the <IslandName> Bank.
MILBURN/BankConversation_Intro_001	Hmph. What do you need?
MILBURN/BankConversation_Option_000	Show me my account.
MILBURN/BankConversation_Option_001	Let's chat.
MILBURN/BankConversation_Option_002	Nevermind.
MILBURN/BankConversation_Response_000_000	Ok. Lets take a look...
MILBURN/BankConversation_Response_002_000	Have a great day.
MILBURN/Buy_ATM_Convo_Intro_000	Hmmph. 
MILBURN/Buy_ATM_Convo_Intro_001	So that <buyItemName> has caught your eye?
MILBURN/Buy_ATM_Convo_Intro_002	<yes>It allows you to withdraw your funds from your account.
MILBURN/Buy_ATM_Convo_Intro_003	<yes>Even when the bank is closed.
MILBURN/Buy_ATM_Convo_Intro_004	However, you will still have to visit the branch to deposit.
MILBURN/Buy_ATM_Convo_Intro_005	It can be yours for the low price of <buyItemPrice>?
MILBURN/Buy_ATM_Convo_Option_000	I'll take it!
MILBURN/Buy_ATM_Convo_Option_001	No thanks
MILBURN/Buy_ATM_Convo_Response_000_000	Hmmph.
MILBURN/Buy_ATM_Convo_Response_000_001	I hope you enjoy it.
MILBURN/Buy_ATM_Convo_Response_001_000	<no>Very well then.
MILBURN/CompleteBirthday_000_Intro_000	<proud>Hmph.
MILBURN/CompleteBirthday_000_Intro_001	I usually buy my own <birthday> gifts.
MILBURN/CompleteBirthday_000_Intro_002	Thank you, <PlayerName>.
MILBURN/CompleteRequest_000_Intro_000	<proud>Hmph.
MILBURN/CompleteRequest_000_Intro_001	Very good.
MILBURN/CompleteRequest_000_Intro_002	I suppose you would like a reward now?
MILBURN/Introduction_010_Intro_000	<PlayerName> I assume?þ
MILBURN/Introduction_010_Intro_001	<proud>My name is <myName>.
MILBURN/Introduction_010_Intro_002	<yes>I am the new banker here on <IslandName>þ.
MILBURN/Introduction_010_Intro_003	Am I to understand that you were instrumental in getting my magnificent bank built?
MILBURN/Introduction_010_Intro_004	<proud>Well, trust me, the honour is all yours for having <myName> here on your tiny little island.þ
MILBURN/Introduction_010_Intro_005	Hmph. Using my bank will be free, of course.
MILBURN/Introduction_010_Intro_006	Would you like me to explain how the bank works?þ
MILBURN/Introduction_010_Option_000	Yes please.
MILBURN/Introduction_010_Option_001	I get it.
MILBURN/Introduction_010_Response_000_000	Well it’s very simple.þ
MILBURN/Introduction_010_Response_000_001	Any <Dinks> you deposit in the bank will slowly accrue interest.
MILBURN/Introduction_010_Response_000_002	<no>Hmph. You'll be bleeding me dry, I tell you!
MILBURN/Introduction_010_Response_000_003	Additionally, any <Dinks> you place into your account can be extracted from any other bank you visit.
MILBURN/Introduction_010_Response_000_004	That means if you visit somewhere and they have a bank, you can withdraw what few precious little <Dinks> you have deposited.
MILBURN/Introduction_010_Response_000_005	<yes>Finally, I offer a little exchange scheme.
MILBURN/Introduction_010_Response_000_006	You see, I happen to have to many <PermitPoints>.
MILBURN/Introduction_010_Response_000_007	<no>And you can never have have too many <Dinks>.
MILBURN/Introduction_010_Response_000_008	So come and speak to me during my operating hours to exhange <Dinks> for <PermitPoints>
MILBURN/Introduction_010_Response_001_000	<thinking>Ah, I see, someone on this island who knows the ins and outs of finance.
MILBURN/Introduction_010_Response_001_001	<yes>Looking forward to seeing your <Dinks>, <PlayerName>.
MILBURN/IslandDayGreeting_AfterNoon_010_Intro_000	Hmph.þ
MILBURN/IslandDayGreeting_AfterNoon_010_Intro_001	Today has been satisfactory so far.þ
MILBURN/IslandDayGreeting_AfterNoon_010_Intro_002	However, I do doubt that the “surprise” <NPCName> has in store for us tonight will impress me.þ
MILBURN/IslandDayGreeting_Morning_010_Intro_000	<no>Hmph.þ
MILBURN/IslandDayGreeting_Morning_010_Intro_001	What even is a <SnagSizzle>?þ
MILBURN/IslandDayGreeting_Morning_010_Intro_002	What’s so good about <Snags> anyway?þ
MILBURN/IslandDayGreeting_Night_010_Intro_000	Hmph.þ
MILBURN/IslandDayGreeting_Night_010_Intro_001	I don’t know what to say.þ
MILBURN/IslandDayGreeting_Night_010_Intro_002	I’ve never seen anything like this before...þ
MILBURN/IslandDayGreeting_Noon_010_Intro_000	Hmph.þ
MILBURN/IslandDayGreeting_Noon_010_Intro_001	I hate to admit it.þ
MILBURN/IslandDayGreeting_Noon_010_Intro_002	<no>But these “<Snags>” are actually very nice.þ
MILBURN/IslandDayGreeting_Noon_010_Intro_003	<yes>I will have to invest in some more of these.þ
MILBURN/RandomConvo_000_Intro_000	You know what I always say, <PlayerName>?
MILBURN/RandomConvo_000_Intro_001	<yes>You’ve got to speculate to accumulate.
MILBURN/RandomConvo_000_Intro_002	Remember that!
MILBURN/RandomConvo_001_Intro_000	You know what I always say, <PlayerName>?
MILBURN/RandomConvo_001_Intro_001	<yes>Diversify! Diversify! Diversify!
MILBURN/RandomConvo_001_Intro_002	Remember that!
MILBURN/RandomConvo_002_Intro_000	It’s important to shares, <PlayerName>
MILBURN/RandomConvo_002_Intro_001	<haha>I should know. I own them all!
MILBURN/RandomConvo_003_Intro_000	You know what I always say, <PlayerName>?
MILBURN/RandomConvo_003_Intro_001	<yes>There’s the one percent, and the won percent!
MILBURN/RandomConvo_003_Intro_002	<proud>Let me tell you, <PlayerName>, I always win.
MILBURN/RandomConvo_004_Intro_000	<thinking>If I had all the gold in the world, I would buy more gold with it, and then sell that gold for fat stacks of gold.
MILBURN/RandomConvo_004_Intro_001	<thinking>Hmph...
MILBURN/RandomConvo_004_Intro_002	<haha>I’d be a bullionaire!
MILBURN/RandomConvo_005_Intro_000	Counting money can be exhausting. <sigh>
MILBURN/RandomConvo_005_Intro_001	What?
MILBURN/RandomConvo_005_Intro_002	<no>There's no way I would pay someone to do that!
MILBURN/RandomConvo_005_Intro_003	<pumped>I've got to hold on to every single Dink I can.þ
MILBURN/RandomConvo_006_Intro_000	<thinking>I was visited in my sleep by three ghosts once.
MILBURN/RandomConvo_006_Intro_001	<shocked>They said they wanted to take me on a life changing journey!
MILBURN/RandomConvo_006_Intro_002	<no>Too bad for them that they couldn't afford my hourly rate, so I just went back to sleep.
MILBURN/RandomConvo_007_Intro_000	<yes>Hmph, things ran better back in <SouthCity>.þ
MILBURN/RandomConvo_007_Intro_001	People had more trust in banks back there.þ
MILBURN/RandomConvo_007_Intro_002	People just did what they were told!þ
MILBURN/RandomConvo_008_Intro_000	I’ll tell you what, back in <SouthCity> everyone knew who I was.þ
MILBURN/RandomConvo_008_Intro_001	<proud>I was constantly getting recognised.þ
MILBURN/RandomConvo_008_Intro_002	<no>Why, I could hardly walk down the street without being booed.þ
MILBURN/RandomConvo_009_Intro_000	<thinking>They say <Dinks> make the world go around...
MILBURN/RandomConvo_009_Intro_001	But go around where? 
MILBURN/RandomConvo_009_Intro_002	How many?
MILBURN/RandomConvo_009_Intro_003	<angry>And, more importantly, what’s the world doing going around with my <Dinks>?
MILBURN/RandomConvo_010_Intro_000	<no>I don’t really have time to talk right now.
MILBURN/RandomConvo_010_Intro_001	<yes>Time is <Dinks> and my time is worth more <Dinks> than yours, <PlayerName>.þ
MILBURN/RandomConvo_011_Intro_000	<yes>Give a man a <Dink> and he’ll eat for a day.
MILBURN/RandomConvo_011_Intro_001	<proud>Give a man a million <Dinks> and that man will never work again!þ
MILBURN/RandomConvo_011_Intro_002	<yes>A very wise and true proverb that I live my life by, <PlayerName>.þ
MILBURN/RandomConvo_012_Intro_000	<yes>Although I do miss <SouthCity>, I think there's some incredible opportunities here on <IslandName>.þ
MILBURN/RandomConvo_012_Intro_001	<glee>A brand new market ripe for exploitation.þ
MILBURN/RandomConvo_012_Intro_002	<shy>Exploration, I mean exploration, of course.þ
MILBURN/RandomConvo_013_Intro_000	<thinking>Hmph, I'd love to cut costs at the bank...
MILBURN/RandomConvo_013_Intro_001	<no>But, I simply can't afford to lower my salary.þ
MILBURN/RandomConvo_014_Intro_000	<proud>Don't worry, your <Dinks> are safe with me!
MILBURN/RandomConvo_014_Intro_001	<glee>Plus, they have a boatload of other <Dinks> to play with.
MILBURN/RandomConvo_015_Intro_000	I started out with a small loan of 1,000,000 <Dinks> from my father.þ
MILBURN/RandomConvo_015_Intro_001	<haha>Hmph, and now, I run my own bank!þ
MILBURN/RandomConvo_015_Intro_002	<shy>I know, I know, I’m very humble.þ
MILBURN/RandomConvo_016_Intro_000	<glee>I love the rain.
MILBURN/RandomConvo_016_Intro_001	<yes>It's nature's way of giving my building a free wash.
MILBURN/RandomConvo_016_Intro_002	<haha>You just can't beat free!
MILBURN/RandomConvo_017_Intro_000	<worried>Try not to take out too many <Dinks> at once, it makes me sweat like crazy.
MILBURN/RandomConvo_017_Intro_001	<shy>Withdrawal symptoms are no joke.
MILBURN/RandomConvo_018_Intro_000	<no>I didn’t really need <PermitPoints> back in <SouthCity>.þ
MILBURN/RandomConvo_018_Intro_001	<yes>You don’t need a <Licence> to do anything if you just pay someone with a <Licence> to do it for you!þ
MILBURN/RandomConvo_019_Intro_000	<no>I never did eat <BlobFish>.þ
MILBURN/RandomConvo_019_Intro_001	<shocked>Why would I ever sully my taste buds on something that looks so ghastly!þ
MILBURN/RandomConvo_019_Intro_002	<proud>I would always import fine foods from other places!þ
MILBURN/RandomConvo_020_Intro_000	<thinking>I’ve seen you out there breaking rocks and chopping trees.þ
MILBURN/RandomConvo_020_Intro_001	Have you ever though of maybe paying someone else to do all that hard work for you?þ
MILBURN/RandomConvo_020_Intro_002	Hmph. I guess you can't afford that?þ
MILBURN/RandomConvo_021_Intro_000	<thinking>You know, <PlayerName>...
MILBURN/RandomConvo_021_Intro_001	<thinking>I never realised how much money you inject into the economy here on <IslandName>.þ
MILBURN/RandomConvo_021_Intro_002	<shy>Maybe you aren’t so bad after all?þ
MILBURN/RandomConvo_022_Intro_000	You know that famous saying, “A <Dink> in the bank is better than a <Dink> in the hand”?
MILBURN/RandomConvo_022_Option_000	I know it
MILBURN/RandomConvo_022_Option_001	That's not a saying.
MILBURN/RandomConvo_022_Response_000_000	<proud>I’m the one that came up with that saying.
MILBURN/RandomConvo_022_Response_000_001	<angry>And don't listen to anyone else who says they did!
MILBURN/RandomConvo_022_Response_001_000	<angry>How dare you!þ
MILBURN/RandomConvo_022_Response_001_001	<proud>I’m the one that came up with that saying.
MILBURN/RandomConvo_022_Response_001_002	<angry>I’ve been trying to settle a legal battle for years in regards to that!þ
MILBURN/RandomConvo_023_Intro_000	You know what I like about you, <PlayerName>?þ
MILBURN/RandomConvo_023_Intro_001	<no>You’re not great at anything. Not good, even.þþ
MILBURN/RandomConvo_023_Intro_002	But you’re still out there, day after day.þ
MILBURN/RandomConvo_023_Intro_003	<yes>Just having a go. Giving it a shot.þ
MILBURN/RandomConvo_023_Intro_004	<yes>Marvellous.þ
MILBURN/RandomConvo_024_Intro_000	<thinking>Whenever I’m feeling down, I find it helps to imagine that somewhere out there, a lot of people are feeling a whole lot worse.
MILBURN/RandomConvo_024_Intro_001	<proud>With not nearly as many <Dinks>!þ
MILBURN/RandomConvo_024_Intro_002	<haha>It never fails to brighten my day.
MILBURN/RandomConvo_025_Intro_000	<sigh>Childhood was a difficult time for me.
MILBURN/RandomConvo_025_Intro_001	So much to learn, you see.þWhich bell to ring for afternoon tea?
MILBURN/RandomConvo_025_Intro_002	Which spoon to use for what?
MILBURN/RandomConvo_025_Intro_003	<yes>Oh, the servants tried their best, of course.
MILBURN/RandomConvo_025_Intro_004	<no>It was impossible to find good help.
MILBURN/RandomConvo_026_Intro_000	<yes>People in charge should stay in charge.þ
MILBURN/RandomConvo_026_Intro_001	<thinking>It’s so obvious, really. þ
MILBURN/RandomConvo_026_Intro_002	Experience, see.
MILBURN/RandomConvo_026_Intro_003	<no>Can’t beat it.þ
MILBURN/RandomConvo_027_Intro_000	<no>I feel like there are FAR too many resources here on <IslandName>!þ
MILBURN/RandomConvo_027_Intro_001	If everybody has everything they need, what’s the point of being rich?þ
MILBURN/RandomConvo_027_Intro_002	<proud>Hmph.
MILBURN/RandomConvo_027_Intro_003	<thinking>How will people know I’m better than them?
MILBURN/RandomConvo_028_Intro_000	Remember, <PlayerName>, if everybody can afford your services, þ
MILBURN/RandomConvo_028_Intro_001	<pumped>You aren’t charging enough.þ
MILBURN/RandomConvo_029_Intro_000	<glee>You’ll be happy to hear that I’ve reinforced the pockets of my suit.
MILBURN/RandomConvo_029_Intro_001	<yes><Dinks> can be quite heavy, you know.
MILBURN/RandomConvo_029_Intro_002	<proud>No escapees on my watch!
MILBURN/RandomConvo_030_Intro_000	You know, you are almost tolariable sometimes, <PlayerName>.þ
MILBURN/RandomConvo_030_Intro_001	<yes>Especially when you are making a deposit into your account.þ
MILBURN/RandomConvo_031_Intro_000	Sometimes I can be a bit harsh on you, <PlayerName>.þ
MILBURN/RandomConvo_031_Intro_001	<thinking>You see, I’ve grown up knowing I’m better than everyone else.þ
MILBURN/RandomConvo_031_Intro_002	<no>I’ve got to remember it doesn’t mean everyone else is rubbish.
MILBURN/RandomConvo_032_Intro_000	What is that grotty old <Journal> you carry around all the time, anyway?þ
MILBURN/RandomConvo_032_Intro_001	<haha>If I were you I would spend a few <Dinks> to get a new one!þ
MILBURN/RandomConvo_032_Intro_002	<no>That looks like it's decades old!þ
MILBURN/RandomConvo_033_Intro_000	You know, <PlayerName>.þ
MILBURN/RandomConvo_033_Intro_001	<yes>I’ve got to say, you are always very helpful when it comes to fulfilling my requests.þ
MILBURN/RandomConvo_033_Intro_002	Luckily, I always reward you accordingly, so a thanks isn’t really required here, is it?þ
MILBURN/RandomConvo_034_Intro_000	If I had to guess, you might be the second wealthiest person on <IslandName>, <PlayerName>.þ
MILBURN/RandomConvo_034_Intro_001	<proud>Hmph, of course I’m including my future inheritance that I am owed.þ..
MILBURN/RandomConvo_035_Intro_000	<shy><IslandName> isn’t that bad after you spend a while here, I guess.þ
MILBURN/RandomConvo_035_Intro_001	<no>Oh, please, don’t get me wrong, <PlayerName>.þ
MILBURN/RandomConvo_035_Intro_002	<proud>As soon as I get the chance I’m going to return to my lovely abode back in <SouthCity>.þ
MILBURN/RandomConvo_035_Intro_003	<yes>I have an indoor swimming pool there you know.þ

NED/RandomConvo 0_Intro_000	Stay alert, <PlayerName>.
NED/RandomConvo 0_Intro_001	<yes>Threats can emerge from anywhere out here.
NED/RandomConvo 1_Intro_000	<no>There ain't nothing like living off the land.
NED/RandomConvo 1_Intro_001	It's bloody thrilling!
NED/RandomConvo 10_Intro_000	Maintaining your equipment is not only Mission-Critical, it’s also the best way to spend a Sundy arvo.
NED/RandomConvo 10_Intro_001	<yes>Fact. 
NED/RandomConvo 11_Intro_000	I reckon everyone back in <SouthCity> needs to come here for a night or two.

NED/RandomConvo 13_Intro_001	<no>You’re just not good enough for that yet.þ
NED/RandomConvo 14_Intro_000	<proud>The key to victory is always winning your battles!
NED/RandomConvo 15_Intro_000	The birds around here are hard to sneak up on...
NED/RandomConvo 15_Intro_001	I wonder if there is a way to attact them into a trap?
NED/RandomConvo 15_Intro_002	What do birds eat again?
NED/RandomConvo 16_Intro_000	You ever see something strange out here at night?
NED/RandomConvo 16_Intro_001	No, I don't mean me.
NED/RandomConvo 17_Intro_000	<proud>I never run away from a challenge.
NED/RandomConvo 17_Intro_001	Unless that challenge has big teeth and it's way to close.
NED/RandomConvo 18_Intro_000	It's so good to see a youngen like yourself out here exploring.
NED/RandomConvo 18_Intro_001	We need more people like you, <PlayerName>.
NED/RandomConvo 2_Intro_000	<no>Weapons aren’t toys you know.
NED/RandomConvo 2_Intro_001	<yes>They are tools we use to defend ourselves and hunt for food.
NED/RandomConvo 3_Intro_000	Where am I from?
NED/RandomConvo 3_Intro_001	I'm from the wilds, mate.
NED/RandomConvo 3_Intro_002	Grew up wild and I'll bloody die wild.

NED/RandomConvo 4_Intro_001	<yes>Fine quality in a person.
NED/RandomConvo 5_Intro_000	I’m not the strongest swimmer.
NED/RandomConvo 5_Intro_001	<worried>I steer clear of <animalName>.
NED/RandomConvo 5_Intro_002	<proud>They stay in the water and I stay on the land.
NED/RandomConvo 6_Intro_000	<no>Never smile at a <animalName>.
NED/RandomConvo 6_Intro_001	<no>And you certainly don't want to see them smile back at you!
NED/RandomConvo 7_Intro_000	Hunting is a fine sport, <PlayerName>.
NED/RandomConvo 7_Intro_001	<proud>But there is one thing I can't hunt down...
NED/RandomConvo 7_Intro_002	<haha>A true blue challenge.
NED/RandomConvo 8_Intro_000	If I had any advice for a whipper snapper like yourself it'd be this;
NED/RandomConvo 8_Intro_001	Find a passion,  and hold on to it like it owes you something!
NED/RandomConvo 8_Intro_002	Go at it tooth and nail! <pumped>
NED/RandomConvo 9_Intro_000	<proud>Weapons and me go together like spaghetti and blankets.

RANDOMISED/RandomConvo_010_Intro_000	<yes>Make sure you water your crops every day.
RANDOMISED/RandomConvo_010_Intro_001	The soil will stay wet for a day or so, but if you see the ground is dry give them a sprinkle.
RANDOMISED/RandomConvo_010_Intro_002	<no>If you dont water them, they wont grow.
RANDOMISED/RandomConvo_011_Intro_000	You should try burning <itemName> in a campfire.

RANDOMISED/RandomConvo_012_Intro_000	<yes>If you are having trouble with birds eating your crops, try and craft a <itemName>.

RANDOMISED/RandomConvo_015_Intro_001	<yes>Well, did you know you can also fill it at a fountain or a well?
RANDOMISED/RandomConvo_016_Intro_000	<thinking>I've heard of a thing called a <itemName>...
RANDOMISED/RandomConvo_016_Intro_001	With one of those you can soar through the air like a bird!
RANDOMISED/RandomConvo_016_Intro_002	<haha>A non-flying, gliding bird!
RANDOMISED/RandomConvo_017_Intro_000	<yes>Doing jobs for people can really make them happy you know.

RANDOMISED/RandomConvo_019_Intro_001	But they are somewhat common place these days.
RANDOMISED/RandomConvo_020_Intro_000	If you clear out some grass you might encourage flowers to grow there a few days later!
RANDOMISED/RandomConvo_020_Intro_001	But if you want to grow flowers very quickly. Craft some <itemName>. 
RANDOMISED/RandomConvo_020_Intro_002	If you plant some flowers in a <itemName> and keep the <itemName> next to them empty...
RANDOMISED/RandomConvo_020_Intro_003	<glee>Some new flowers might sprout up next to them!
RANDOMISED/RandomConvo_021_Intro_000	If you have a <itemName> you can go fishing out in the deep ocean!
RANDOMISED/RandomConvo_021_Intro_001	<thinking>I heard there are some big fish out there!

RANDOMISED/RandomConvo_024_Intro_000	There is a really rare butterfly called a <itemName>.
RANDOMISED/RandomConvo_024_Intro_001	I would love to see one some day...
RANDOMISED/RandomConvo_025_Intro_000	The Visitor was a great idea, <PlayerName>.

RAYNE/RandomConvo_017_Intro_001	<no>It was, like, so cold and lifeless. þ
RAYNE/RandomConvo_017_Intro_002	Who would even waste time making junk like that?
RAYNE/RandomConvo_018_Intro_000	<proud>I think my plants can be a little like me sometimes.
RAYNE/RandomConvo_018_Intro_001	<glee>But they just love the sun and are always reaching for the sky!
RAYNE/RandomConvo_019_Intro_000	<no>Even after all these years, I still can’t get my head around how much can grow from so little.
RAYNE/RandomConvo_019_Intro_001	Just one little seed can grow, like, massive?

RAYNE/RandomConvo_021_Intro_003	<pumped>Bonza.
RAYNE/RandomConvo_022_Intro_000	<thinking>The rain saves me so much time watering plants sometimes.þþþ
RAYNE/RandomConvo_022_Intro_001	<no>It's still a bummer though.þ
RAYNE/RandomConvo_022_Intro_002	<haha>Like, good job, but go away already, right?þ
RAYNE/RandomConvo_023_Intro_000	It can be hard to lose some of your crops. þþ
RAYNE/RandomConvo_023_Intro_001	<no>I don’t like to talk about it, but it like, happened to me once or twice.þ
RAYNE/RandomConvo_023_Intro_002	<glee>Just look after them like you’ve been looking after me and everything will work out just fine.

RAYNE/RandomConvo_032_Intro_000	<shy>It’s, like, always a pleasure to see you, <PlayerName>. þ
RAYNE/RandomConvo_032_Intro_001	<glee>The way you run around town helping everyone out, it’s like, totally bonza.þ
RAYNE/RandomConvo_033_Intro_000	<no>I, like, never thought I would call one place home before.
RAYNE/RandomConvo_033_Intro_001	<shy>Not until now at least!
RAYNE/RandomConvo_033_Intro_002	<no>I guess I’m not a <Nomad> anymore. þ
RAYNE/RandomConvo_033_Intro_003	I guess I’m, like, a <IslandName> resident!þ
RAYNE/RandomConvo_034_Intro_000	<shy>You know, <PlayerName>, I consider you, like, one of my closest friends.
RAYNE/RandomConvo_034_Intro_001	<shy>I feel like I should be more upfront with the people I care about.þ
RAYNE/RandomConvo_034_Intro_002	<haha>So there. Was that like, upfront enough? þ
RAYNE/RandomConvo_035_Intro_000	<yes>I feel like our friendship has, like, really grown, <PlayerName>.
RAYNE/RandomConvo_035_Intro_001	<haha>And no one even had to water it!

RAYNE/SkyFest_AfterNoon_000_Intro_000	<pumped>This is my favourite part of <SkyFest>!
RAYNE/SkyFest_AfterNoon_000_Intro_001	<glee>The part where we all, like, get to fly a <Kite>!
RAYNE/SkyFest_AfterNoon_000_Intro_002	<shy>I used to love doing this with my family.
RAYNE/SkyFest_AfterNoon_000_Intro_003	Chasing the <PaperLanterns> through the sky is the highlight of <SkyFest> for me.
RAYNE/SkyFest_AfterNoon_000_Intro_004	<shy>It, like, reminds me of home!
RAYNE/SkyFest_Morning_000_Intro_000	Hey, <PlayerName>!
RAYNE/SkyFest_Morning_000_Intro_001	<glee>Happy <SkyFest>!
RAYNE/SkyFest_Morning_000_Intro_002	This event is, like, really special to me.
RAYNE/SkyFest_Morning_000_Intro_003	<glee>I’m so excited!
RAYNE/SkyFest_Night_000_Intro_000	Isn’t that <Aurora> amazing, <PlayerName>?
RAYNE/SkyFest_Night_000_Intro_001	What a, like, totally bonza <SkyFest> Fletch has thrown for us.
RAYNE/SkyFest_Night_000_Intro_002	<shy>I thought I was going to have a hard time today. 
RAYNE/SkyFest_Night_000_Intro_003	<no>Like, I really miss my family and stuff.
RAYNE/SkyFest_Night_000_Intro_004	<glee>But I guess everyone here on <IslandName> is, like, a new family.
RAYNE/SkyFest_Noon_000_Intro_000	I’ve made my <Kite>!
RAYNE/SkyFest_Noon_000_Intro_001	It’s like, totally bonza.
RAYNE/SkyFest_Noon_000_Intro_002	<glee>I can't wait to fly it!
RAYNE/TownMention_Level_001_Intro_000	<PlayerName>, you’ve really done a great job getting <IslandName> up and running.þ
RAYNE/TownMention_Level_001_Intro_001	This place is, like, going to be bonza. þ
RAYNE/TownMention_Level_002_Intro_000	Have I mentioned how bonza <IslandName> is looking and stuff.þ
RAYNE/TownMention_Level_002_Intro_001	It’s, like, looking better and better every day.þ
RAYNE/TownMention_Level_002_Intro_002	<glee>And it’s all thanks to you, <PlayerName>.þ
RAYNE/TownMention_Level_003_Intro_000	I love what you’ve been doing around here, <PlayerName>.þ
RAYNE/TownMention_Level_003_Intro_001	<yes>You obviously, like, put a lot of work into the town. þ
RAYNE/TownMention_Level_003_Intro_002	<glee>It’s so bonza having you around <IslandName>þ
RAYNE/TownMention_Level_004_Intro_000	<no>þI can’t believe this is the same <IslandName> I used to visit in my little tent!þþ
RAYNE/TownMention_Level_004_Intro_001	<pumped>This place is, like, amazing and stuff.þ
RAYNE/TownMention_Level_004_Intro_002	<yes>You should be so proud of yourself, <PlayerName>.þ
RAYNE/TownMention_Level_004_Intro_003	<glee>Keep up the bonza work!þþþ
SALLY/CompleteBirthday_000_Intro_000	Oh, <PlayerName>!
SALLY/CompleteBirthday_000_Intro_001	<shy>This is a really nice <birthday> gift.
SALLY/CompleteBirthday_000_Intro_002	<glee>Thank you very much.
SALLY/CompleteRequest_000_Intro_000	<pumped>You’re a bloody legend, <PlayerName>.
SALLY/CompleteRequest_000_Intro_001	<yes>Too bloody good I reckon.
SALLY/CompleteRequest_000_Intro_002	Take this for your trouble!
SALLY/Gossip_About_NPC_000_Intro_000	Just between you and me...þ
SALLY/Gossip_About_NPC_000_Intro_001	<yes>I heard <NPCName> grows her hair herself.þ
SALLY/Gossip_About_NPC_000_Intro_002	<haha>From the ground, I mean.
SALLY/Gossip_About_NPC_001_Intro_000	<pumped><NPCName> won’t let anybody NEAR his hair.þ
SALLY/Gossip_About_NPC_001_Intro_001	<no>I offered to trim his beard, but I ended up walking away with a bunch of tools I don’t need?þ
SALLY/Gossip_About_NPC_001_Intro_002	<boohoo>…they were really expensive.þ
SALLY/Gossip_About_NPC_002_Intro_000	<NPCName>’s hair grows really slowly…þ
SALLY/Gossip_About_NPC_002_Intro_001	Either that, or he trims it himself, I guess?þ
SALLY/Gossip_About_NPC_003_Intro_000	<NPCName> comes to see me every now and again.
SALLY/Gossip_About_NPC_003_Intro_001	I guess he really likes the empty bit in the middle?þ
SALLY/Gossip_About_NPC_003_Intro_002	<thinking>He’d have such long, full, beautiful locks if I didn’t cut his hair so often…þ
SALLY/Gossip_About_NPC_003_Intro_003	Each to their own, I guess.þ
SALLY/Gossip_About_NPC_004_Intro_000	<no><NPCName> asked me to cut her doll’s hair once.þ
SALLY/Gossip_About_NPC_004_Intro_001	<no>It looked just like her, but tiny!þ
SALLY/Gossip_About_NPC_004_Intro_002	<scared>That thing gave me the creeps.þ
SALLY/Gossip_About_NPC_006_Intro_000	<yes><NPCName> keeps asking if I have a Hair Cutting licence.þ
SALLY/Gossip_About_NPC_006_Intro_001	<pumped>And I keep telling her there is no such thing!þ
SALLY/Gossip_About_NPC_006_Intro_002	<haha>But she seems adamant that there should be!þ
SALLY/Gossip_About_NPC_007_Intro_000	<glee><NPCName>’s hair is sooo soft!þþ
SALLY/Gossip_About_NPC_007_Intro_001	<glee>It’s like <animalName> and clouds and the wind from a butterfly’s wings…þ
SALLY/Gossip_About_NPC_009_Intro_000	<thinking><NPCName> always asks to keep his hair clippings after a trim.þ
SALLY/Gossip_About_NPC_009_Intro_001	<yes>He said something about cataloguing every strand?þ
SALLY/Gossip_About_NPC_010_Intro_000	<no><NpcName> never tips me when he comes in for a trim.þ
SALLY/Gossip_About_NPC_010_Intro_001	<no>I mean, I don’t ask for tips, anyway.þ
SALLY/Gossip_About_NPC_010_Intro_002	<thinking>But he always makes sure to let me know he won’t be tipping…þ
SALLY/HairDresserConvo_Intro_000	Welcome!
SALLY/HairDresserConvo_Intro_001	Can I interest you in a little trim?
SALLY/HairDresserConvo_Option_000	Yes please!
SALLY/HairDresserConvo_Option_001	I wanted to chat.
SALLY/HairDresserConvo_Option_002	No thanks.
SALLY/HairDresserConvo_Response_000_000	Please take a seat!
SALLY/HairDresserConvo_Response_002_000	If you change your mind, drop by.
SALLY/HairDresserInSeatConv_Intro_000	Okay, what can do with your "doo" today? <haha>
SALLY/HairDresserInSeatConv_Intro_001	A haircut or colour change is <sprite=11>5000.
SALLY/HairDresserInSeatConv_Option_000	A new hairstyle!
SALLY/HairDresserInSeatConv_Option_001	A new hair colour!
SALLY/HairDresserInSeatConv_Option_002	I've changed my mind.
SALLY/HairDresserInSeatConv_Response_000_000	Alright! Lets get started!
SALLY/HairDresserInSeatConv_Response_001_000	Alright! Lets get started!
SALLY/HairDresserInSeatConv_Response_002_000	I see. Style isn't for everyone!
SALLY/Introduction_008_Intro_000	Hey there, I’m <myName>.þ
SALLY/Introduction_008_Intro_001	<glee>I’m a hairstylistþ!
SALLY/Introduction_008_Intro_002	<shy>I’m kinda new at it though.þ
SALLY/Introduction_008_Intro_003	<glee>If you would like a haircut I could always use the practice!þ
SALLY/IslandDayGreeting_AfterNoon_008_Intro_000	I’m having a bloody bonza day, <PlayerName>.þ
SALLY/IslandDayGreeting_AfterNoon_008_Intro_001	How are you enjoying yourself?þ
SALLY/IslandDayGreeting_AfterNoon_008_Intro_002	I hope you got a <Snag> while they were still hot!þ
SALLY/IslandDayGreeting_Morning_008_Intro_000	Happy <IslandDay>, <PlayerName>.þ
SALLY/IslandDayGreeting_Morning_008_Intro_001	It’s going to be a great day, full of tunes, sun and some bloody beautiful <Snags>.
SALLY/IslandDayGreeting_Morning_008_Intro_002	It's going to be grouse!
SALLY/IslandDayGreeting_Night_008_Intro_000	Wow!þ
SALLY/IslandDayGreeting_Night_008_Intro_001	<glee>I am really digging the sky’s new colours tonight.þ
SALLY/IslandDayGreeting_Night_008_Intro_002	<thinking>It's kinda like beautiful hair...
SALLY/IslandDayGreeting_Night_008_Intro_003	It’s amazing, isn’t it, <PlayerName>?þ
SALLY/IslandDayGreeting_Noon_008_Intro_000	<NPCName> made me a rippa of a <Snag>!þ
SALLY/IslandDayGreeting_Noon_008_Intro_001	<no>Everything I cook usually ends up with some hair in it.þ
SALLY/IslandDayGreeting_Noon_008_Intro_002	<yes>At least I know it’s not my own hair.þ
SALLY/IslandDayGreeting_Noon_008_Intro_003	<worried>That would be so gross.þ
SALLY/RandomConvo_000_Intro_000	My family would never let me near their hair.
SALLY/RandomConvo_000_Intro_001	<no>They said that I'd always cut something of theirs that wasn't hair.
SALLY/RandomConvo_000_Intro_002	<haha>Did they not know that looking good can sometimes hurt?
SALLY/RandomConvo_001_Intro_000	<thinking>Back when I was studying to be a chef I would always cut my fingers.
SALLY/RandomConvo_001_Intro_001	<haha>I'm just not that great at using anything sharp!
SALLY/RandomConvo_002_Intro_000	I worked in the coal mines back in <SouthCity> for a few years...
SALLY/RandomConvo_002_Intro_001	<yes>I use to cut some of my friends hair while we were down there.
SALLY/RandomConvo_002_Intro_002	Everyone said they loved what I did…
SALLY/RandomConvo_002_Intro_003	<boohoo>Until we all came back up into the light...
SALLY/RandomConvo_003_Intro_000	<shy>I tend to get a bit shaky when I get nervous.
SALLY/RandomConvo_003_Intro_001	<shy>I mean, that would be okay if I didn't get so nervous when I was giving haircuts!
SALLY/RandomConvo_004_Intro_000	<yes>Hair is like nature's clothing.
SALLY/RandomConvo_004_Intro_001	<glee>And just like clothes, the way you style it can show off your personality!
SALLY/RandomConvo_005_Intro_000	<thinking>I've been thinking about dying my hair.
SALLY/RandomConvo_005_Intro_001	<no>I wish knew a hairdresser…
SALLY/RandomConvo_005_Intro_002	<shocked>Oh wait!þ
SALLY/RandomConvo_006_Intro_000	<yes>I've been pretty happy with myself lately, <PlayerName>. þ
SALLY/RandomConvo_006_Intro_001	<proud>I haven't cut anyone's ear off or anything since I started visiting <IslandName>.þ
SALLY/RandomConvo_007_Intro_000	<thinking>Before I was a hairdresser I had a part-time job as a pet stylist.
SALLY/RandomConvo_007_Intro_001	<glee>It's where I learnt my best cuts and styles!
SALLY/RandomConvo_007_Intro_002	<yes>They’re amazing innovative styles, so nobody asks for them a second time.
SALLY/RandomConvo_008_Intro_000	Have you ever tried cutting topiaries? 
SALLY/RandomConvo_008_Intro_001	<yes>You should totally do it if you get the chance.
SALLY/RandomConvo_008_Intro_002	<haha>It's wonderfully fun and the plants don't even complain when you mess it up!
SALLY/RandomConvo_009_Intro_000	<yes>I've had a lot of jobs before I settled on hairstylist.
SALLY/RandomConvo_009_Intro_001	<yes>My parents told me to do what I was good at.
SALLY/RandomConvo_009_Intro_002	<proud>But I think that's just too easy!
SALLY/RandomConvo_010_Intro_000	<thinking>Hey, <PlayerName>, I was thinking about taking on an apprentice...
SALLY/RandomConvo_010_Intro_001	Maybe they could teach me a thing or two?
SALLY/RandomConvo_011_Intro_000	<yes>The best thing about hair is that it grows back, so we can always try again.
SALLY/RandomConvo_011_Intro_001	<shy>Not that we’ll need to! It’s just nice to have some backup options.
SALLY/RandomConvo_011_Intro_002	But, have you considered going bald, <PlayerName>?
SALLY/RandomConvo_012_Intro_000	<proud>I am, without a doubt, the absolute best hairdresser here on <IslandName>.
SALLY/RandomConvo_012_Intro_001	<haha>I mean, honestly, it’s not even close!
SALLY/RandomConvo_013_Intro_000	<glee>I'm doing a special today!
SALLY/RandomConvo_013_Intro_001	<pumped>50 percent off!
SALLY/RandomConvo_013_Intro_002	...
SALLY/RandomConvo_013_Intro_003	<shy>Full price though.
SALLY/RandomConvo_014_Intro_000	<yes>Some of my best customers pay me NOT to cut their hair.
SALLY/RandomConvo_014_Intro_001	<glee>They’re such darlings.
SALLY/RandomConvo_015_Intro_000	<pumped>My whole life people have been trying to take sharp objects away from me, but look at me now!
SALLY/RandomConvo_015_Intro_001	<haha>I’m my own boss!
SALLY/RandomConvo_015_Intro_002	<dance>Scissors forever!
SALLY/RandomConvo_015_Intro_003	<shy>I’m so, so sorry, <PlayerName>. I don’t know what came over me.
SALLY/RandomConvo_016_Intro_000	People back in <SouthCity> generally went for the boring haircuts.
SALLY/RandomConvo_016_Intro_001	<yes>So it's nice to be doing something different here on <IslandName>.
SALLY/RandomConvo_017_Intro_000	<proud>I’m the best at jigsaw puzzles.
SALLY/RandomConvo_017_Intro_001	<pumped>Give me any two pieces and I can make em fit together no problem!
SALLY/RandomConvo_018_Intro_000	<thinking>I think a <animalName> would make excellent hairdresser.
SALLY/RandomConvo_018_Intro_001	<yes>With their sharp jagged teeth and persistent attitude, they have all the right qualities.
SALLY/RandomConvo_018_Intro_002	<worried>I really hope one of them doesn’t open up a shop around here, or I’d be out of business!
SALLY/RandomConvo_019_Intro_000	<no>Don’t let anybody ever tell you that you can’t do something.
SALLY/RandomConvo_019_Intro_001	<no>Even if you have none of the skills, or are poorly suited, or are physically incapable, it doesn’t matter!
SALLY/RandomConvo_019_Intro_002	<pumped>Do what I did and just do it anyway!
SALLY/SkyFest_AfterNoon_008_Intro_000	You know what?
SALLY/SkyFest_AfterNoon_008_Intro_001	<no>My <Kite> didn’t turn out half bad after all?
SALLY/SkyFest_AfterNoon_008_Intro_002	<yes>It’s not how it looks, but how it flies!
SALLY/SkyFest_AfterNoon_008_Intro_003	<haha>Kinda like the haircuts I give, right <PlayerName>?
SALLY/SkyFest_Morning_008_Intro_000	Hey <PlayerName>.
SALLY/SkyFest_Morning_008_Intro_001	Glad to see you could make it to <SkyFest>.
SALLY/SkyFest_Morning_008_Intro_002	Let’s have some fun!
SALLY/SkyFest_Night_008_Intro_000	Woah!
SALLY/SkyFest_Night_008_Intro_001	So this is what an <Aurora> looks like?
SALLY/SkyFest_Night_008_Intro_002	I guess I really didn’t pay attention before now?
SALLY/SkyFest_Night_008_Intro_003	<glee>It’s beautiful!
SALLY/SkyFest_Noon_008_Intro_000	<boohoo>I should have asked for some help with my <Kite>...
SALLY/SkyFest_Noon_008_Intro_001	<no>I’m just not good with scissors!
SALLY/SkyFest_Noon_008_Intro_002	<shy>I guess it doesn’t matter in the end, as long as it flies okay.
SALLY/SkyFest_Noon_008_Intro_003	Right?
SHEILA/CompleteBirthday_000_Intro_000	<pumped>Oh, what a bonza <birthday> gift!
SHEILA/CompleteBirthday_000_Intro_001	<yes>You’re too good to me <PlayerName>.
SHEILA/CompleteBirthday_000_Intro_002	<glee>Thank you!
SHEILA/CompleteRequest_000_Intro_000	<glee>You bloody beauty!
SHEILA/CompleteRequest_000_Intro_001	Thanks a bunch, <petName>.
SHEILA/CompleteRequest_000_Intro_002	You always pull through!
SHEILA/IslandDayGreeting_AfterNoon_012_Intro_000	<no>First <NPCName> cooks the best snag I’ve ever had.
SHEILA/IslandDayGreeting_AfterNoon_012_Intro_001	<shock>And she has the nerve to say there is still a surprise tonight?þ
SHEILA/IslandDayGreeting_AfterNoon_012_Intro_002	<no>You know what, if I didn’t love that woman…þ
SHEILA/IslandDayGreeting_Morning_012_Intro_000	Oh, hi there <petName>.þ
SHEILA/IslandDayGreeting_Morning_012_Intro_001	I’m really looking forward to a <IslandDay> snag.þ
SHEILA/IslandDayGreeting_Morning_012_Intro_002	<yes>I reckon <NPCName> knows what she’s doing.þ
SHEILA/IslandDayGreeting_Morning_012_Intro_003	<haha>But between you and me, it’s taking a lot of willpower to not snatch those tongs out of her hands.þ
SHEILA/IslandDayGreeting_Night_012_Intro_000	All those colours…þ
SHEILA/IslandDayGreeting_Night_012_Intro_001	<thinking>Do you reckon the sky can taste them?þ
SHEILA/IslandDayGreeting_Night_012_Intro_002	<yes>I hope they taste good.þ
SHEILA/IslandDayGreeting_Night_012_Intro_003	<haha>Because they look like they do!þ
SHEILA/IslandDayGreeting_Noon_012_Intro_000	<boohoo>I’m tempted to hang up me apron.þ
SHEILA/IslandDayGreeting_Noon_012_Intro_001	<no><NPCName> is an amazing cook.þ
SHEILA/IslandDayGreeting_Noon_012_Intro_002	<shy>I can’t believe she made everyone their own custom <Snag>.þ
SHEILA/IslandDayGreeting_Noon_012_Intro_003	She really knows everyone here on <IslandName>.þ
SHEILA/IslandDayGreeting_Noon_012_Intro_004	<yes>I reckon she's having the best day of her life.
SHEILA/IslandDayGreeting_Noon_012_Intro_005	Happy <IslandDay>, mate.
SHEILA/NothingToGiveBugComp_Intro_000	Oh, you don't have any bugs after all?
SHEILA/NothingToGiveBugComp_Intro_001	<boohoo>Why did you trick me...
SHEILA/NothingToGiveTuckshop_Intro_000	Oh, you don't have anything tasty to sell?
SHEILA/NothingToGiveTuckshop_Intro_001	<no>No worries, mate.
SHEILA/RandomConvo_000_Intro_000	I’d love to talk, <petName>, but it’s been all go today.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_000_Intro_001	<no>I’ve been flat out like a <animalName> swimming! þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_001_Intro_000	<IslandName> is the only place I’ve seen anything grow in a long while.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_001_Intro_001	<yes>What a great place for finding fresh ingredients.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_001_Intro_002	<shy>I’m bonza at cooking, but there’s only so much you can do with <BlobFish>.
SHEILA/RandomConvo_002_Intro_000	<proud>I won’t stand for any trouble at my place.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_002_Intro_001	<no>First whiff of a barney, and you’ll be out on your ear!þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_003_Intro_000	<proud>Tell me what you’ve got at home and I reckon I can make a feast out of it.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_003_Intro_001	<no>You don’t need fancy ingredients to make something special.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_003_Intro_002	<haha>It sure helps though!þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_004_Intro_000	I heard some people eat <animalName>.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_004_Intro_001	<no>They’re not for me, they’re far too tough.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_004_Intro_002	<thinking>Still, anything’s better than nothing when you’re hungry, I reckon.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_005_Intro_000	<yes>I think it’s great to talk about your problems.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_005_Intro_001	<haha>Just not to me, <petName>.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_005_Intro_002	<proud>I’ve got a business to run!þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_006_Intro_000	<glee>Nothing beats a true-blue sunrise, I reckon.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_006_Intro_001	<yes>Best time of the day, the morning.
SHEILA/RandomConvo_006_Intro_002	<proud>Everybody’s still fast asleep and you can go about your business without anybody bothering you.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_007_Intro_000	<no>You’d never catch me down in the deep mines!þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_007_Intro_001	<shy>I wouldn’t mind the dark, but I just can’t stand bats.
SHEILA/RandomConvo_007_Intro_002	<no>They’re too flappy, for a start. þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_007_Intro_003	Oh and that screeching? Forget it!þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_008_Intro_000	Back in <SouthCity>, I was expected to do nothing but cook <Blobfish> and keep my mouth shut.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_008_Intro_001	<haha>Sure, I says, I can do that, when <animalName> fly mate!
SHEILA/RandomConvo_008_Intro_002	Sling your hook, I says, I’m outta this dump!þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_008_Intro_003	Best decision I ever made, <petName>l.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_009_Intro_000	<yes>I always have a nibble of everything I make.
SHEILA/RandomConvo_009_Intro_001	<proud>Quality control, yeah?þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_009_Intro_002	<shy>Of course, sometimes I have too many nibbles and there’s none left for the customers!þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_009_Intro_003	<haha>Especially on Sundays, mind.
SHEILA/RandomConvo_009_Intro_004	<glee>Sunday is treat day.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_010_Intro_000	<no>I swear, some people would just sit around all flaming day if they had the chance.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_010_Intro_001	<no>Staying cooped up every day is no good for you.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_010_Intro_002	<thinking>You’ve got to be kind to your body if you want it to last.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_010_Intro_003	<pumped>Take it out for walks! Go for a swim! þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_010_Intro_004	<yes>Anything is better than nothing, I reckon.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_011_Intro_000	<thinking>Make sure you’re getting your blood pumping at least thirty minutes a day.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_011_Intro_001	<yes>Out there in the real world, I mean.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_011_Intro_002	<haha>You don’t want your heart getting lazy, you’ll probably need it later!þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_012_Intro_000	Still gallivanting around all over town, are you?þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_012_Intro_001	<sigh>I’d join you if I wasn’t so busy at work.
SHEILA/RandomConvo_012_Intro_002	<proud>There’s nothing like fresh air to keep your ticker ticking.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_012_Intro_003	<yes>Remember to take regular breaks, <petName>. þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_013_Intro_000	<yes>A good meal is something you really want to take your time with.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_013_Intro_001	<proud>My stuff’s for savouring.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_013_Intro_002	<shock>Some people out there just put the food up to their mouths and are finished in three bites!þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_013_Intro_003	How crazy is that?þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_013_Intro_004	<no>Within a second there’s nothing left but quickly vanishing crumbs!þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_013_Intro_005	<no>Unbelievable!þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_014_Intro_000	I think it’s bonza we were given this chance to start again.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_014_Intro_001	<shy>It takes a brave soul to pack everything up and move on, if I do say so myself.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_014_Intro_002	I think this place is shaping up wonderfully though, <petName>.
SHEILA/RandomConvo_015_Intro_000	I don’t need somebody else to do everything for me.
SHEILA/RandomConvo_015_Intro_001	<yes>You can always rely on yourself, I reckon. þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_015_Intro_002	Oh sure, <PlayerName>, you might fetch me a few things here and there.
SHEILA/RandomConvo_015_Intro_003	And you might have helped build my shop.
SHEILA/RandomConvo_015_Intro_004	<proud>But everything else was good old fashioned <myName>!þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_016_Intro_000	Nothing better than some <itemName>to get you going, huh?þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_016_Intro_001	Reckon beans are hard to catch?þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_016_Intro_002	I’ve only had one and I’m bouncing off the walls!þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_017_Intro_000	<thinking>A lot of people don’t put much thought into what they’re having for tea.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_017_Intro_001	<no>Shame for them I reckonþ.
SHEILA/RandomConvo_017_Intro_002	<glee>A tough day can fly by knowing a healthy home cooked feed is waiting at the end of it.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_018_Intro_000	Just because you like everything on the menu doesn’t mean you need to order it all at once, <petName>.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_018_Intro_001	<haha>You can always come back!
SHEILA/RandomConvo_019_Intro_000	<yes>I’ll try anything once, me.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_019_Intro_001	<no>Oh, there’s stuff I’d probably never eat again though.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_019_Intro_002	<proud>That’s what life’s for, I reckon. Trying things.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_019_Intro_003	<haha>I’m here for a good time, not a long time!þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_020_Intro_000	<proud>You’ll never catch me behind a desk, that’s for sure.
SHEILA/RandomConvo_020_Intro_001	<no>Day in day out watching the clock, growing old miserably.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_020_Intro_002	<shy>I guess I don’t need to tell you though!þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_020_Intro_003	I see you with your little legs always running all over the place.
SHEILA/RandomConvo_020_Intro_004	<yes>Always scurrying around here and there, foraging and thwacking things.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_020_Intro_005	<haha>Good work, <PlayerName>!þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_021_Intro_000	<thinking>I’ve always been the busy type. I just like working, I think.þþ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_021_Intro_001	<pumped>Getting. Stuff. Done.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_021_Intro_002	<no>There wasn’t much work in <SouthCity>, or at least, none that mattered to anybody. þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_021_Intro_003	<no>Never made a difference.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_021_Intro_004	<yes>I feel like I’m doing that now though, <petName>.
SHEILA/RandomConvo_021_Intro_005	We’re making a difference here, eh?
SHEILA/RandomConvo_022_Intro_000	You can have all the planning and preparation in the world.
SHEILA/RandomConvo_022_Intro_001	<pumped>But sooner or later you’ve got to actually knuckle down and get things done.
SHEILA/RandomConvo_022_Intro_002	That’s what I like about you, <PlayerName>.
SHEILA/RandomConvo_022_Intro_003	You get stuff done.
SHEILA/RandomConvo_023_Intro_000	It’s all well and good being a little harsh at times.
SHEILA/RandomConvo_023_Intro_001	<yes>Tough love, they call it.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_023_Intro_002	<no>There’s no point being mean just for the sake of it though, and you’ve gotta expect a little back.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_023_Intro_003	<proud>I says, don’t be afraid of speaking your mind, but don’t be surprised when somebody doesn’t wanna hear it either.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_024_Intro_000	<no>You don’t have to love what you do for a living, we’re all just trying to get by.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_024_Intro_001	<yes>You should absolutely find something you love doing though.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_024_Intro_002	<shy>Something you can put your whole heart and soul into, yeah?þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_025_Intro_000	<thinking>I reckon everybody’s passionate about something or other.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_025_Intro_001	<yes>Do what you want, I reckon, as long as you’re not hurting anybody.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_025_Intro_002	<haha>You gotta be you!
SHEILA/RandomConvo_026_Intro_000	I tell you, ever since I’ve been here, it’s like a fog’s been lifted.þþ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_026_Intro_001	<proud>I’m making some of the best feeds I reckon I ever have.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_026_Intro_002	<yes>It’s definitely easier when you’ve got ingredients to work with!þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_027_Intro_000	You know, you’re probably my favourite customer. þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_027_Intro_001	You don’t say much, you always pay your bills, and you’re always ready to lend an ear.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_027_Intro_002	I reckon we mate a cracking great team, <petName>.
SHEILA/RandomConvo_028_Intro_000	I used to hear stories when I was little about what the world outside was like.
SHEILA/RandomConvo_028_Intro_001	<shy>Before Everything Went South, I mean.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_028_Intro_002	<no>I don’t think I ever paid too much attention at first.
SHEILA/RandomConvo_028_Intro_003	I figured they were just stories to pass the time.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_028_Intro_004	<yes>Turns out most of them were right, the good and the bad.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_028_Intro_005	I guess you can’t have one without the other, right, <petName>?þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_029_Intro_000	Sure, you could make what I sell yourself.
SHEILA/RandomConvo_029_Intro_001	You’d have to wait all year, mind.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_029_Intro_002	It might even taste similar, if you’re lucky.
SHEILA/RandomConvo_029_Intro_003	<no>It’s never going to be the same though.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_029_Intro_004	<pumped>The stuff I sell is made with blood, sweat and tears.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_029_Intro_005	<proud>That’s the <myName> guarantee, <petName>!þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_030_Intro_000	It’s been absolutely chockers at my place lately.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_030_Intro_001	<glee>I can’t thank you enough for letting me liven <IslandName> up!þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_030_Intro_002	Thanks again <PlayerName>!þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_031_Intro_000	<no>Big city folk just don’t get it, I reckon.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_031_Intro_001	They’ve got their steel, their concrete, their paperwork… and that’s it!þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_031_Intro_002	<shy>You’ve gotta make time for your friends, yeah?þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_031_Intro_003	<yes>They’re the ones that’ll pull you out of the muck, or listen when you need a good whinge. þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_031_Intro_004	I feel like you get it, <PlayerName>, I really do.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_031_Intro_005	<shy>Thanks for being there, <petName>.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_032_Intro_000	<shy>I had my head in the clouds when I was younger. þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_032_Intro_001	<thinking>I was always dreaming of finer foods.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_032_Intro_002	<no>Nothing too fancy, mind.
SHEILA/RandomConvo_032_Intro_003	<pumped>Just wholesome simple tucker that could fill your belly and keep you fighting fit.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_032_Intro_004	<shy>It’s easy to dream. Doesn’t cost you a <Dink>.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_032_Intro_005	<proud>Putting all this together took some hard yakka though, if I say so myself.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_032_Intro_006	Thanks to you, I reckon I can get you the best tucker on <IslandName>! þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_033_Intro_000	We’d get traders from time to time back in <SouthCity>.
SHEILA/RandomConvo_033_Intro_001	Coming in on their fancy <Airships>.
SHEILA/RandomConvo_033_Intro_002	<Nomads>, they called em.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_033_Intro_003	It was the only time we ever saw or ate anything different.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_033_Intro_004	<proud>I’ll tell you, the first time I ever ate a slice of roo meat… it was like my whole world opened up.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_033_Intro_005	<pumped>So tender, so juicy. I never knew what taste even was before then!þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_033_Intro_006	<no>Of course, the folks in charge would always shut them down right quick, but it didn’t matter.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_033_Intro_007	<pumped>I knew I needed to get out.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_034_Intro_000	There’s nobody to watch your back out in the big city.
SHEILA/RandomConvo_034_Intro_001	<no>If you fall down there, you’ll go right on getting trampled.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_034_Intro_002	<no>Not here though, <PlayerName>.
SHEILA/RandomConvo_034_Intro_003	You’d help me up, right?þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_034_Intro_004	<haha>Of course you would!
SHEILA/RandomConvo_034_Intro_005	<pumped>Just try and trample us here, I reckon!
SHEILA/RandomConvo_034_Intro_006	<angry>We’ll give them what for!þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_034_Intro_007	<proud>That’s mateship, that is.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_035_Intro_000	You can’t always trust people, <PlayerName>, but you can always trust them to be themselves.þþ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_035_Intro_001	As long as you keep that in mind, nothing will surprise you, I reckon.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_035_Intro_002	Anyway, I like you <petName>, but I’ve got work to do!þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_036_Intro_000	<proud>I worked hard to get where I am, I did.
SHEILA/RandomConvo_036_Intro_001	<yes>There was always someone there telling me I couldn’t do it.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_036_Intro_002	I didn’t have a head for business, they says.
SHEILA/RandomConvo_036_Intro_003	<no>My cooking was trash, they says, blah blah blah blah.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_036_Intro_004	<angry>I’d had just about enough of it, so I says, stuff that, and stuff you too!þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_036_Intro_005	<proud>Sooner or later you’ve got to just ignore the whingers and take charge of yourself.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_036_Intro_006	You should listen, <PlayerName>, I bloody wish I did sooner!þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_037_Intro_000	You’re a good egg, <PlayerName>, I mean that.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_037_Intro_001	<shy>I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me natter on.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_037_Intro_002	<haha>Most times I’d be nattering regardless, but it’s nice to have somebody listen!þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_037_Intro_003	You let me know if you need anything, <petName>.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_038_Intro_000	You ever wonder about all that junk buried beneath the surface?þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_038_Intro_001	You reckon someone left it there or what?þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_038_Intro_002	I like to think it was the <animalName>. Nah, hear me out!þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_038_Intro_003	They had all these fancy machines, yeah? All these whirring and buzzing things and what-have-you.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_038_Intro_004	Well, they’ve got them all going full bull at all hours, right?þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_038_Intro_005	Well, <animalName> bossman is cranky now. The head <animalName> or whatever, Top Dog.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_038_Intro_006	He can’t get to sleep, see, on account of all the ruckus.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_038_Intro_007	So one day he says, “Oi, youse!”, he says, “Pack that in, the lot of you!”þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_038_Intro_008	So they do, too.
SHEILA/RandomConvo_038_Intro_009	They bury heaps of it, they do. So’s they can focus on all the regular important <animalName> stuff.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_038_Intro_010	Like, um, burying and sniffing and running and all that malarky.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_038_Intro_011	<yes>That’s my theory anyway.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_039_Intro_000	<no>I’d like to say I was great at rustling up tucker straight from the word Go, but that wouldn’t be true.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_039_Intro_001	<shy>Nah mate, I burned more than a few <itemName> to get here, I did.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_039_Intro_002	<pumped>Ate every single one of them too! Builds character.þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_039_Intro_003	Only way to learn, I reckon. þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_039_Intro_004	<pumped>Not just pies either!
SHEILA/RandomConvo_039_Intro_005	<shy>Nah, I burnt a salad first time I tried it!þ
SHEILA/RandomConvo_039_Intro_006	<haha>Memories.þ
SHEILA/SkyFest_AfterNoon_012_Intro_000	You know what, <petName>?
SHEILA/SkyFest_AfterNoon_012_Intro_001	<yes>Flying this <Kite> is a bit like heating up a pan.
SHEILA/SkyFest_AfterNoon_012_Intro_002	<thinking>And hitting the <PaperLanterns> is like adding some nice veggies to the pan.
SHEILA/SkyFest_AfterNoon_012_Intro_003	And exchanging the <itemName> for prizes?
SHEILA/SkyFest_AfterNoon_012_Intro_004	<haha>Well, that’s nothing like cooking at all!
SHEILA/SkyFest_Morning_012_Intro_000	Howdy, <petName>.
SHEILA/SkyFest_Morning_012_Intro_001	Ready for the <SkyFest> festivities today?
SHEILA/SkyFest_Night_012_Intro_000	You know what?
SHEILA/SkyFest_Night_012_Intro_001	<yes>I’ve had a wonderful day today, <petName>.
SHEILA/SkyFest_Night_012_Intro_002	<thinking>And this <Aurora> is a great way to end a great day.
SHEILA/SkyFest_Night_012_Intro_003	<yes>Every day here on <IslandName> gets better and better.
SHEILA/SkyFest_Noon_012_Intro_000	<yes>If only making a <Kite> was more like cooking.
SHEILA/SkyFest_Noon_012_Intro_001	<shy>I mean, I aced making my <Kite> and everything.
SHEILA/SkyFest_Noon_012_Intro_002	<haha>Just prefer cooking!
SHEILA/SomethingToSellBugComp_Intro_000	<glee>WOW!

SHEILA/TotalEqualsZeroBugComp_Intro_001	It seems these items aren't worth anything, but I can still take them off your hands if you don't want them?

THEODORE/Introduction_009_Intro_002	<proud>I’m <myName>.
THEODORE/Introduction_009_Intro_003	<glee>I'd love to open a museum here on <IslandName>.
THEODORE/Introduction_009_Intro_004	We could fill it with all the interesting things found here on <IslandName>!
THEODORE/Introduction_009_Intro_005	So please speak to <NPCName> about building the museum as soon as possible!
THEODORE/IslandDayGreeting_AfterNoon_009_Intro_000	I think I’m going to write a paper about <IslandDay> and why it’s so good.þ
THEODORE/IslandDayGreeting_AfterNoon_009_Intro_001	<thinking>Maybe that’s the surprise <NPCName> has for us tonight!þ
THEODORE/IslandDayGreeting_AfterNoon_009_Intro_002	<glee>Everyone gets to write an essay!þ
THEODORE/IslandDayGreeting_Morning_009_Intro_000	Oh, G’day <PlayerName>.þ
THEODORE/IslandDayGreeting_Morning_009_Intro_001	<no>I’m not even going to step foot into the Museum today.þ
THEODORE/IslandDayGreeting_Morning_009_Intro_002	<shy>I’ve been told to relax and take it easy for <IslandDay>.þ
THEODORE/IslandDayGreeting_Night_009_Intro_000	Oh my!
THEODORE/IslandDayGreeting_Night_009_Intro_001	The sky!þ
THEODORE/IslandDayGreeting_Night_009_Intro_002	<yes>It’s absolutely incredible.þ
THEODORE/IslandDayGreeting_Night_009_Intro_003	I’ve never seen something so amazing.þ
THEODORE/IslandDayGreeting_Night_009_Intro_004	Are you seeing this, <PlayerName>?þ
THEODORE/IslandDayGreeting_Noon_009_Intro_000	<NPCName> has outdone herself.þ
THEODORE/IslandDayGreeting_Noon_009_Intro_001	<yes>This is the best <Snag> I’ve ever had.þ
THEODORE/IslandDayGreeting_Noon_009_Intro_002	Part of me wants to put what’s left of my <Snag> into an exhibit, just to save it for later.
THEODORE/IslandDayGreeting_Noon_009_Intro_003	<haha>But it’s too tasty.þ
THEODORE/ItemNotNeeded_Intro_000	Hmmmm... The museum isn't really looking for this kind of thing.
THEODORE/ItemNotNeeded_Intro_001	Our collection include, fish, bugs and relics. If there are any other items you don't want, maybe consider selling them?
THEODORE/ItemNotNeeded_Intro_002	Thanks!
THEODORE/MultipleDonateNoDoubles_Intro_000	<shocked>Oh my!
THEODORE/MultipleDonateNoDoubles_Intro_001	<shy>I see you have quite a few new amazing specimens not yet in our museum!
THEODORE/MultipleDonateNoDoubles_Intro_002	Would you be willing to donate all of these?
THEODORE/MultipleDonateNoDoubles_Option_000	Take them!
THEODORE/MultipleDonateNoDoubles_Option_001	Actually...
THEODORE/MultipleDonateNoDoubles_Response_000_000	<glee>Your generosity is outstanding!
THEODORE/MultipleDonateNoDoubles_Response_000_001	Please accept <donationReward> as a small token of our gratitude!
THEODORE/MultipleDonateNoDoubles_Response_001_000	Oh, I'll give these back then.
THEODORE/MultipleDonateNoDoubles_Response_001_001	If you change your mind, don't hesitate to come back.
THEODORE/MultipleDonateWithDoubles_Intro_000	<shocked>Oh my!
THEODORE/MultipleDonateWithDoubles_Intro_001	<shy>I see you have quite a few new amazing specimens not yet in our museum!
THEODORE/MultipleDonateWithDoubles_Intro_002	Would you be willing to donate all of these?
THEODORE/MultipleDonateWithDoubles_Option_000	Take them!
THEODORE/MultipleDonateWithDoubles_Option_001	Actually...
THEODORE/MultipleDonateWithDoubles_Response_000_000	<glee>Your generosity is outstanding!
THEODORE/MultipleDonateWithDoubles_Response_000_001	I only require one of each specimen, so I’ll return these other ones to you.
THEODORE/MultipleDonateWithDoubles_Response_000_002	Please accept <donationReward> as a small token of our gratitude!
THEODORE/MultipleDonateWithDoubles_Response_001_000	Oh, I'll give these back then.
THEODORE/MultipleDonateWithDoubles_Response_001_001	If you change your mind, don't hesitate to come back.
THEODORE/MuseumKeeperConvo_Intro_000	Welcome to the museum!
THEODORE/MuseumKeeperConvo_Intro_001	What can I do for you?
THEODORE/MuseumKeeperConvo_Option_000	I have a donation.
THEODORE/MuseumKeeperConvo_Option_001	I want to chat.
THEODORE/MuseumKeeperConvo_Option_002	Nevermind.
THEODORE/MuseumKeeperConvo_Response_000_000	OH! What have you brought me?
THEODORE/MuseumKeeperConvo_Response_002_000	Please, have a look around.
THEODORE/NoItemsGiven_Intro_000	Oh, nothing to donate then? That's fine!
THEODORE/NoItemsGiven_Intro_001	<sigh>Although you did get my hopes up...
THEODORE/NonLocalEmpty_Intro_000	Oh, that's an empty frame.
THEODORE/NonLocalEmpty_Intro_001	<glee>We actually encourage locals to donate their own photos to display here!
THEODORE/NonLocalPicture_Intro_000	Oh! What a wonderful photo that is!
THEODORE/NonLocalPicture_Intro_001	<getPhotoDetails>
THEODORE/NonLocalPicture_Intro_002	The photographer is very talented!
THEODORE/RandomConvo_000_Intro_000	<thinking>Museums are very important for society.
THEODORE/RandomConvo_000_Intro_001	Imagine if we just kept all the old stuff where we found it?
THEODORE/RandomConvo_000_Intro_002	<worried>It would be all over the place!
THEODORE/RandomConvo_000_Intro_003	<shocked>Chaos!
THEODORE/RandomConvo_001_Intro_000	<yes>I’ve really been enjoying documenting all the new species on this island.
THEODORE/RandomConvo_001_Intro_001	<glee>To tell you the truth though, filing the documentation is nearly as enjoyable!
THEODORE/RandomConvo_002_Intro_000	<worried>Fish and bugs are very interesting, but I really don't like touching either...
THEODORE/RandomConvo_002_Intro_001	<yes>That’s fine though.
THEODORE/RandomConvo_002_Intro_002	<proud>After all, things in a museum are for looking at, not touching.
THEODORE/RandomConvo_003_Intro_000	<thinking>I’ve been wondering if there could be a way to catalogue air?
THEODORE/RandomConvo_003_Intro_001	Would you be interested in seeing an air exhibit, <PlayerName>? 
THEODORE/RandomConvo_003_Option_000	Oh yeah!
THEODORE/RandomConvo_003_Option_001	Not Really
THEODORE/RandomConvo_003_Response_000_000	<glee> See, I had a feeling you were a fellow air-head!
THEODORE/RandomConvo_003_Response_000_001	I’ll ask around town and see if I can find some more people who are interested! <glee>þ
THEODORE/RandomConvo_003_Response_001_000	<sigh>þAh, that’s a shame. I’ve already collected a bunch of specimens in some jars...
THEODORE/RandomConvo_004_Intro_000	<thinking>Paperwork can be very time consuming.
THEODORE/RandomConvo_004_Intro_001	<haha>But they say time flies when you are having fun!
THEODORE/RandomConvo_005_Intro_000	<yes>If you ever take a great photo and you want to show it off, please come and display it in the museum.
THEODORE/RandomConvo_005_Intro_001	<yes>Don't worry, I will fill out the required forms for you!
THEODORE/RandomConvo_005_Intro_002	<glee>It would be my absolute pleasure!
THEODORE/RandomConvo_006_Intro_000	<proud>It’s so great to have a one stop shop to look at all the interesting stuff around here.
THEODORE/RandomConvo_006_Intro_001	What?
THEODORE/RandomConvo_006_Intro_002	<shocked>John’s Goods?
THEODORE/RandomConvo_006_Intro_003	<no>No, no, no.
THEODORE/RandomConvo_006_Intro_004	<angry>I meant the museum!
THEODORE/RandomConvo_007_Intro_000	<glee>There are so many new species to study here on <IslandName>!
THEODORE/RandomConvo_007_Intro_001	<worried> Oh no!
THEODORE/RandomConvo_007_Intro_002	<no>I don’t mean I’m going to cut them open!
THEODORE/RandomConvo_007_Intro_003	<proud>Here at the <IslandName> museum we only study by observing!
THEODORE/RandomConvo_008_Intro_000	 <thinking>Imagine if we could take everything on <IslandName> and put it in a museum!
THEODORE/RandomConvo_008_Intro_001	<proud>That way, when people wanted to see a certain thing, they could just make their way to that wing!
THEODORE/RandomConvo_009_Intro_000	Studying things is just my job.
THEODORE/RandomConvo_009_Intro_001	<yes>I have plenty of other hobbies.
THEODORE/RandomConvo_009_Intro_002	<glee>For example, in my spare time I like to talk about all the things I’ve been studying.
THEODORE/RandomConvo_010_Intro_000	<thinking>I think one day we’ll see a Museum of Museums.
THEODORE/RandomConvo_010_Intro_001	<yes>Truly the pinnacle of society.
THEODORE/RandomConvo_010_Intro_002	All that knowledge, all those exhibits, all that paperwork!
THEODORE/RandomConvo_010_Intro_003	<glee>So beautiful.
THEODORE/RandomConvo_011_Intro_000	<thinking>I'd love to experience some more travelling one day.
THEODORE/RandomConvo_011_Intro_001	<no>As long as I don't have to actually go anywhere else, of course.
THEODORE/RandomConvo_011_Intro_002	<pumped>We could get exhibits from all over the world, and bring them right to <IslandName>!
THEODORE/RandomConvo_012_Intro_000	<no>I don’t go outside too much.
THEODORE/RandomConvo_012_Intro_001	<worried>There’s not enough order out there so it can get a bit overwhelming.
THEODORE/RandomConvo_012_Intro_002	<worried>All the plants and people and animals are just going around doing whatever they want, all over the place!
THEODORE/RandomConvo_012_Intro_003	<shocked>Chaos!
THEODORE/RandomConvo_013_Intro_000	<thinking>There’s so many different ways to organise things and group them together.
THEODORE/RandomConvo_013_Intro_001	<yes>Playing around with them can be exciting.
THEODORE/RandomConvo_013_Intro_002	<pumped>Sometimes I’ll go around and rearrange everything alphabetically, then by height, and sometimes even by smell!
THEODORE/RandomConvo_013_Intro_003	<yes>That last one is really easy to do, because everything smells like disinfectant, like it should.þ
THEODORE/RandomConvo_014_Intro_000	<shy>Sometimes I like to climb into an empty case and pretend I’M the exhibit.
THEODORE/RandomConvo_014_Intro_001	<haha>I’m a perfect candidate too, because I never try and escape.
THEODORE/RandomConvo_015_Intro_000	<shy>Sometimes I stand really really still and pretend I’m a statue...
THEODORE/RandomConvo_015_Intro_001	<haha>It makes me feel marble-ous!þ
THEODORE/RandomConvo_015_Intro_002	Just a little museum humour for you, <PlayerName>.
THEODORE/RandomConvo_016_Intro_000	<thinking>It must be nice to be getting watched all day.
THEODORE/RandomConvo_016_Intro_001	<worried>I don’t think I could handle the attention though.
THEODORE/RandomConvo_016_Intro_002	<thinking>Though, maybe if people formed an orderly queue it wouldn’t freak me out so much?
THEODORE/RandomConvo_017_Intro_000	<yes>I’m a huge fan of music.
THEODORE/RandomConvo_017_Intro_001	<no>I don’t listen to it, of course, it’s far too noisy.
THEODORE/RandomConvo_017_Intro_002	But there’s so many different ways to catalogue and arrange it.
THEODORE/RandomConvo_017_Intro_003	<thinking>You can organise by artist, genre, length, beats per minute…
THEODORE/RandomConvo_017_Intro_004	<glee>So many possibilities!
THEODORE/RandomConvo_018_Intro_000	<glee>What a beautiful day it is!
THEODORE/RandomConvo_018_Intro_001	<yes>Perfect weather to be indoors and studying!
THEODORE/RandomConvo_019_Intro_000	<glee>I just love the smell of fresh paper.
THEODORE/RandomConvo_019_Intro_001	<yes>All neatly arranged, lined up and ready for work.
THEODORE/RandomConvo_019_Intro_002	<pumped>Sometimes I feel bad writing on it, but we're doing really important work here.
THEODORE/RandomConvo_019_Intro_003	<yes>So its all worth it!
THEODORE/RandomConvo_020_Intro_000	What’s the point of anything happening if nobody is there to record it?
THEODORE/RandomConvo_020_Intro_001	<yes>Hey, <PlayerName>, if a tree falls in the woods, please be sure to let me know.
THEODORE/SkyFest_AfterNoon_009_Intro_000	<yes>Hello, <PlayerName>.
THEODORE/SkyFest_AfterNoon_009_Intro_001	How is your <PaperLantern> hunt going?
THEODORE/SkyFest_AfterNoon_009_Intro_002	<shy>I can’t say that I’ve hit any down as of yet.
THEODORE/SkyFest_AfterNoon_009_Intro_003	<shy>To be honest I’m a bit concerned that <itemName> might fall on my head…
THEODORE/SkyFest_Morning_009_Intro_000	Greetings, <PlayerName>.
THEODORE/SkyFest_Morning_009_Intro_001	I’m not in the Museum today, no.
THEODORE/SkyFest_Morning_009_Intro_002	I thought it might be nice to join in on the <SkyFest> celebrations instead.
THEODORE/SkyFest_Morning_009_Intro_003	<shy>However, I do wish we could celebrate inside…
THEODORE/SkyFest_Night_009_Intro_000	<pumped>This is incredible!
THEODORE/SkyFest_Night_009_Intro_001	<glee>I guess it was well worth going outside for <SkyFest>!
THEODORE/SkyFest_Night_009_Intro_002	<thinking>I do worry how the museum is fairing without me..
THEODORE/SkyFest_Night_009_Intro_003	<yes>But I guess I should be focusing on this <Aurora>!
THEODORE/SkyFest_Noon_009_Intro_000	<yes>Yes I have my <Kite> already.
THEODORE/SkyFest_Noon_009_Intro_001	<yes>I decided to use my <Kite> from last year.
THEODORE/SkyFest_Noon_009_Intro_002	<shy>That way I wasn’t required to share any of the equipment.
THEODORE/SkyFest_Noon_009_Intro_003	<shy>I just prefer to not share things like that.
THEODORE/Thank you_Intro_000	Thank you! It looks great up here doesn't it?
